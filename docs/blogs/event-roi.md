For event organisers to get larger budgets for future events, you have to prove your [event ROI](event-roi.html) first. Like anyone else, the management needs to see returns before they are willing to invest more. So how do you ensure that you will get the maximum return?

One of the key ways to demonstrate your event’s ROI is by leveraging data. Event apps can play a significant role in this by tracking metrics such as attendee engagement, session popularity, and networking interactions.

### What Is Event ROI?

Event ROI measures the value you gain from hosting an event compared to what you spend on it. It’s a way to gauge if your event was worth the investment.

To [calculate event ROI](how-to-maximize-event-roi.html), you’ll subtract the total cost of your event from the total value it generated. This gives you a clear picture of the event’s financial impact. But remember, ROI isn’t just about money. It can include intangible benefits like brand awareness, networking opportunities, and customer relationships.

Figuring out your event’s ROI can be tricky, especially when it comes to measuring those non-financial benefits. But don’t worry! With some careful planning and the right metrics, you can get a good handle on your event’s success. So, next time you’re planning an event, keep ROI in mind. It’s a handy way to gauge whether your event efforts paid off and how they aligned with your goals.
