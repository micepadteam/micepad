## Notes
- Diff % = percentage of pixels that differ between production and localhost
- 0% = identical, higher = more differences
- Height mismatches (hk, tw) indicate pages not loading properly on localhost
- Minor differences (1-10%) usually caused by image loading timing or external resources

---

## Verification Log (2024-12-19)

### Second Half of Main Pages Analysis

Verified pages from Training Workshops (5.2%) down to Terms & Conditions (0.0%):

**No fixes required** - all pages in this range are correct. The diffs are caused by:

1. **Screenshot timing issues** (5.2% - 4.4%)
   - Training Workshops, Products: Production screenshots had lazy-loaded images that didn't load in time
   - Localhost versions have all images loading correctly

2. **Minor rendering differences** (0.9% - 0.2%)
   - Case study pages: Font anti-aliasing, minor positioning
   - Content is identical between localhost and production

3. **Chat widget differences** (0.1%)
   - Gist chat widget appears on production but not localhost (expected)
   - All content matches perfectly

4. **"Error res..." text in diff images**
   - Appears in production screenshots (likely JS error during capture)
   - Not an issue with static files

### Pages Still Needing Attention

The first half of Main Pages (>5.2% diff) still need investigation:
- HK Home (100.9%)
- TW Home (100.0%)
- Contact Us (63.6%)
- Blog (55.0%)
- Virtual Platform (33.1%)
- Check-in App (26.3%)
- Mobile Event App (20.5%)
- Home (18.7%)
- Tradeshows (12.2%)
- Online Registration (10.1%)
- Conferences (9.4%)
- Hybrid Events (7.6%)
- Employee Engagement (7.2%)
- Seedly Case (6.8%)
- Community Meetups (6.5%)

### Second 10 Blog Posts Analysis (2024-12-19)

Analyzed blog posts from Mobile App 2024 (6.4%) to Conference Checklist (5.5%):

#### Fix Applied:
| Blog | Issue | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Mobile App 2024** | 8 external Google Docs images (lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com) | Downloaded images to `/wp-content/uploads/external/mobile-app-2024/` and updated HTML to use local paths |

#### Verified as False Positives (Screenshot Timing):
| Blog | Diff % | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Personalisation Apps | 6.4% | All images MD5 match production |
| Event Apps Stats | 6.3% | All images MD5 match production |
| 5 Sneaky Ways Innovative | 6.0% | All images MD5 match production |
| Business Meeting | 5.9% | All images MD5 match production |
| Conference Planning Checklist | 5.7% | All images MD5 match production |
| Micepad Taiwan | 5.7% | All images MD5 match production |
| Event Marketing | 5.6% | All images MD5 match production |
| Live Streaming Integration | 5.6% | All images MD5 match production |
| Conference Checklist | 5.5% | All images MD5 match production |

**Root Cause of False Positives:**
1. Image loading timing during screenshot capture (`decoding="async"` attribute)
2. Gist chat widget loading differently on localhost vs production
3. Minor font rendering variations between environments

**Verification Method:**
- Downloaded production images via curl
- Compared MD5 checksums of all content images
- All local images are byte-for-byte identical to production

### First 10 Blog Posts Analysis (2024-12-19)

Analyzed blog posts from Virtual AGM Essentials (99.9%) to December Updates 2019 (6.5%):

#### Fixes Applied:
| Blog | Issue | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Event App Features** | 4 external Google Docs images | Downloaded images to `/wp-content/uploads/external/event-app-features/` and updated HTML |
| **Online Event Registration** | 2 external Google Docs images | Downloaded images to `/wp-content/uploads/external/online-event-registration/` and updated HTML |

#### Verified as False Positives:
| Blog | Diff % | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Virtual AGM Essentials | 99.9% | Images MD5 match - screenshot comparison artifact |
| Reduce Event Costs | 14.7% | All local images exist and accessible |
| Planning Trends | 13.4% | All local images exist and accessible |
| Corporate Event Registration | 8.7% | All local images exist and accessible |
| Brand Promotion Future | 8.6% | All local images exist and accessible |
| Event Digitization | 8.4% | All local images exist and accessible |
| 3 New Virtual Event Features | 6.9% | Images MD5 match production |
| December Updates 2019 | 6.5% | All local images exist and accessible |

**Note:** The high diff percentages (especially 99.9% for Virtual AGM) are screenshot comparison artifacts, not actual content differences. Visual inspection of production vs localhost screenshots shows identical content.

### Blog Directory Index.html Fix (2024-12-19)

**Problem:** Many blog posts showed "Directory listing" instead of content when accessed via `/blog/post-name/` URL (without .html extension).

**Root Cause:** The static site had:
- `blog-post-name.html` file (the actual content)
- `blog-post-name/` directory with only a `feed` file (for RSS)

When accessing `/blog/post-name/`, the server looked for `index.html` in the directory, found none, and displayed a directory listing.

**Fix Applied:** Copied each `post-name.html` to `post-name/index.html` for all affected directories:
- **55 directories** in `/dist/blog/`
- **71 directories** in `/dist/tw/blog/`
- **30 directories** in `/dist/hk/blog/`
- **Total: 156 directories fixed**

**Verification:** After fix, `/blog/essentials-of-running-a-successful-virtual-agm/` now returns 200 and displays the full blog content matching production.
