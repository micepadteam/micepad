Sometimes less is more. This minimal layout strips away all distractions, leaving only the content.

> Good design is as little design as possible.

## When to Use This

The minimal layout works best for:

- Long-form articles
- Essays and thought pieces
- Content that deserves full attention

There's no sidebar, no flashy colors, no distractions. Just words on a page, the way it should be.

## Typography Matters

Notice the serif font, generous line height, and comfortable reading width. Every detail is intentional.

The max-width of 650px keeps lines from getting too long, which would tire the reader's eyes.
