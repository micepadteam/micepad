<h3 id="5-reasons-event-app-help-you-increase-event-roi">5 Reasons Event App Help You Increase Event ROI</h3>

<p>If you have been attending events in the past year or so, you would have realised many events include an event app now. They are becoming a standard, something that people feel uncomfortable without. So how does event app affect you in increasing event ROI? Here’s how.</p>

<h4 id="1-reducing-cost-and-increasing-productivity">1. Reducing Cost and Increasing Productivity</h4>

<p>Save trees and save cost. Papers are so passé. Admit it, you don’t like holding on to pieces of papers especially when you are going to be walking around the whole day. Then why would you print event agenda or brochures for your attendees? The last thing you want them to do is to dump those papers once they turn away from you.</p>

<p>Worse still, what if you notice a minor mistake only after you have printed it? Edit that mistake and send it for printing again? Such a waste of time. You should be spending your time more effectively doing other things that are more productive.</p>

<p>However, with an event app, you can definitely edit those mistakes even minutes before your event starts. Attendees can also have access to all your event information anytime they need it. More importantly, you get to reduce your printing costs significantly.</p>

<h4 id="2-increasing-sponsor-opportunities">2. Increasing Sponsor Opportunities</h4>

<p><a href="../index.html">Event management platform</a> presents many opportunities to clinch new event sponsorship deals. You can create a sponsor page in the event app that lists all your sponsors’ information, logos and HTML links. You can even allow them to place images in the moving banner to increase their exposure.</p>

<h4 id="3-giving-attendees-a-voice">3. Giving Attendees a Voice</h4>

<p>What about your attendees? One of the main reasons why organisers use event apps is to drive <a href="enhances-audience-engagement-with-event-app.html">audience engagement</a>. As we have always seen in Q&amp;A, only a handful will ask questions and the rest will continue staring at the speaker.</p>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2021/06/1-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead, posting questions and comments can be alternatives to speaking into the microphone. This will definitely boost the <a href="event-engagement-strategies.html">event engagement</a> and moderators will also have a better sense of the issues to address.</p>

<h4 id="4-gaining-insightstoyour-attendees">4. Gaining Insights to Your Attendees</h4>

<p>I am sure all event organisers will nod their head in unison when I say event ROIs are important. In fact, you can even say that the only way to justify hosting your event is through ROI metrics.</p>

<p>Additionally, these key event insights help you process, understand and bring to light your attendees’ experiences. By gaining a quick understanding of their sentiments, you can relate better to your attendees. Having said that, you can use an event app to set up a live poll to populate real-time responses. You can also get your speakers to co-create their content with the attendees’ responses to build a closer community.</p>

<h4 id="5-data-analytics">5. Data Analytics</h4>

<p>Apart from gathering insights to your attendees’ sentiments, you can also ensure your event success with the real-time analytics. From reviewing discussions to identifying content with the highest viewership to retrieving reports for post-event meetings, an event app can simplify your work process while helping you to monitor event engagement.</p>

<p>Whether you are looking at reducing your printing costs or engaging your attendees, an event app can definitely help to fill the void of your needs. Trust me, once you get started on an event app, you will never want to organise your next event without it again. It provides so much convenience and effectiveness that can help you achieve your objectives better than before!</p>
