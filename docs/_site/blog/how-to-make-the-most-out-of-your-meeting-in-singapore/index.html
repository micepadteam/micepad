  <p>Most MICE events are annual affairs at another country. If your meeting or conference happens to be in Singapore, you’re in luck! Singapore has been ranked as <strong><a href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/why-singapore/about-singapore/facts-and-rankings/rankings.html">Asia’s Leading Meetings and Conference Destination</a> </strong>(World Travel Awards, 2013) and is one of the most consistently rated countries for MICE tourism. In 2011, it contributed 33 per cent of the Republic’s tourism receipts excluding sightseeing and entertainment expenditure. MICE tourism is still consistently booming and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) wants it to <em>**</em><a href="http://business.asiaone.com/news/stb-plans-boost-mice-sector#sthash.WFJj6O7o.dpuf">reach 36 per cent by 2020.</a></p>

<h3 id="plan-your-itinerary">Plan Your Itinerary</h3>

<p>Doing this in advance helps you to chart out your agenda and the location. It helps you to stay on schedule in the midst of all the movements in and out of different meeting locations. This makes travelling much easier for you when you arrive in Singapore. One thing to note when planning your itinerary is to make sure that the information is frequently updated so that you are not surprised by the changes.</p>

<h3 id="have-a-productive-meeting">Have a Productive Meeting</h3>

<p>In order to fulfil the requirements of this visit, the main priority is to ensure that you have a fruitful meeting. The Micepad App has a “email me” function that enables you to send contents of the meeting to your own email for your perusal. This helps you to keep note of what you have gone through in the meeting and allows you to refresh your memory when you go back to your office.</p>

<h3 id="network-with-other-participants">Network With Other Participants</h3>

<p>In 2014, Singapore was named <strong><a href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/why-singapore/about-singapore/facts-and-rankings/rankings.html">Asia’s most network-ready country</a></strong> based on the Global Information Technology Report as conducted by the World Economic Forum. Networking is a great way to increase your connections and learn from the other participants. Keep a stack of business cards on-hand to exchange as you are networking. Even if this is an internal business meeting, you can still get to know the people working in the other departments. This will really help you to expand your reach in the company and there is really no harm in making new connections. What’s more, this can come in handy as you never know when you might need to call in a favour.</p>
