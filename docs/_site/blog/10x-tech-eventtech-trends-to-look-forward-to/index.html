  <p>The first half of 2018 may be over, but we are yet to witness the full scale of tech trends set to wrap 2018 up and commence 2019 with a bang.  Truth be told, it seems that the world of technology is just getting started with boosting events.</p>

<p>This list enumerates 10 new Event Trend that emerged during the latter part of 2018, and are expected to continuously revolutionize how we see events in the years to come.</p>

<h4 id="5g-network">5G Network</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/5g.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>The power of a 5G network is defined by the amount of bandwidth it can host as well as the upgraded data protection it can deliver. Imagine if an event is being held at a WiFi-enabled location. Data transfer speeds are doubled while uploading and downloading files takes less than a minute. With customer satisfaction rising and internet connectivity passing with flying colors, event organizers are given more time to concentrate on polishing on other important components of the event such as content, presentation as well as opportunities for attendees to interact.</p>

<h4 id="augmented-reality-ar-continues-to-dominate">Augmented Reality (AR) Continues to Dominate</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/augmented.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Not only is augmented reality impressive, it is also a hugely convenient factor in planning events. Thanks to augmented reality’s digital alternative to traditional printouts, printing costs and the waste of paper were diminished dramatically. Through scanning an AR’s trigger image using smart devices, attendees can gain vital information about the event.</p>

<p>For brands that wish to introduce their services to a brand new audience, using AI to create a 360 model or representation of the products will surely influence end-user interest in a positive manner. At present, AR content has also evolved into a smarter tool designed to capture attendee feedback and execute event segments with higher precision.</p>

<h4 id="biometric-recognition">Biometric Recognition</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/biometric-1024x576.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Incorporating biometric recognition in events boosts attendee security. Using physical features like fingerprints and countenance, attendees are uniquely identified. The most famous and widely used variation of biometric recognition is facial recognition. Social media giant Facebook has been using this tech feature for photo tagging while some smartphone brands have enabled face recognition as a way for end-users to unlock their smart gadgets. When paired with event management and social media, facial recognition prompts tag suggestions on uploaded pictures.</p>

<p>If attendees take pictures, upload it on Facebook and tag their friends or fellow attendees, chances are the pictures will appear in the feeds of individuals who may be interested in what the event aims to offer. In other words, information and awareness about the event can spread like digital wildfire.</p>

<h4 id="drones">Drones</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/christian-langenhan-588498-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Aside from capturing amazing, breathtaking footage, drones are effective in bringing new event perspectives to the audience. Attendees get to  see the event from different angles and viewpoints, making the experience broader in the eyes of the audience. Drones are likewise highly compatible with fast-paced and outdoor events because of its capability to adapt quickly to drastically changing environments and action-packed activities.</p>

<h4 id="mesh-network">Mesh Network</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/rawpixel-268378-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>A mesh network is  a custom set of WiFi stations that can be installed or set up in various areas across an event’s venue. What makes mesh network a true standout is it is comprised of decentralized, self-configuring, self-healing and wireless LANs. The LANs contain a collection of interconnected nodes; and these nodes can be configured or rerouted depending on the event’s security requirements.</p>

<p>Organizers need not fret about jumbled internet connection or having areas where the WiFi signal is the weakest. A mesh network cannot be influenced by the distance of the attendees from the WiFi hotspot nor is it controlled by the number of devices connected to a hotspot.</p>

<h4 id="radio-frequency-identificationrfid">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/event-check-in.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Ticket payments can be made faster and more hi-tech using radio signals. With RFID, the link between a tag and a reader is used to monitor guest lists more quickly and accurately. The faster an event’s check-in process is, the higher the level of anticipation and engagement attendees will be.</p>

<p>This type of technology is implemented through embedding trackable tags on name badges, wristbands, plastic cards or any other object that attendees will carry with them to the event. Aside from attendees, RFID can also be used for event sponsors as well as creating more unique and innovative polls and raffles.</p>

<h4 id="unique-projection-advertising">Unique Projection Advertising</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/chuttersnap-458798-unsplash-1024x684.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Who’d have thought that using optical illusion and animating static objects can produce a highly captivating and futuristic tool for product promotions and live events? Unique Projection Advertising, also known as projection mapping or spatial augmented reality, maps light on real, solid surfaces such as buildings, indoor objects, and stages. Once a 2D or 3D surface is spatially mapped, interaction with the projector is initiated to fit an image on the physical object where the light is mapped. The object is made to align with the imagery’s features in order to transform the object into a breathtaking 3D art.</p>

<p>Unique Projection Advertising offers an innovative and creative twist to product launches, advertising, event decorations and live events.</p>

<h4 id="voice-technology">Voice Technology</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/30-magazine-event-micepad.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Event techs are not limited to providing convenience and driving higher audience engagement. It can also be used to make events more inclusive. Google’s Machine Learning for speech recognition is a good  example. Its word accuracy rate is effective in providing language translations that would benefit hearing-impaired attendees.</p>

<p>Events become more accessible, and apps or products that can be utilized and controlled via voice command can likewise be made possible.</p>

<h4 id="wearable-technology">Wearable Technology</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/aaron-burden-183659-unsplash-1024x768.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Wearable Technology may have emerged a lot earlier, but it is still being widely used by different industries for a multitude of purposes. Since wearable technology can be synched with a computer and integrated into a person’s clothing or accessories, it can be used to boost attendee security during events. Name badges and profiles can be digitally embedded on an attendee’s watch, thereby making attendee identification and interaction a lot easier to implement.</p>

<h4 id="zero-ui">Zero UI</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/03/eventregistration.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Zero UI basically refers to integrating technology into the entire space to initiate better and more seamless interaction. Technically, it isn’t a new concept. It has been incorporated in various technologies earlier, only this time the way it is interfaced into different devices is modified to suit more complex commands. For example, technologies that use voice recognition and gestures to collect may not be as accurate and multi-dimensional as we think. A simple command such as ‘Call my sister’ may be fulfilled accurately by an AI assistant. But if the command is made more complex, the AI may not be able to fulfill it efficiently. Hence, the need for interfaces that adhere to the psychology of things is a must for the changing demands of consumers.</p>

<p>Anticipatory, automatic, and predictive technology will likely be received more warmly by end-users. In the world of event management, Zero UI shows that events can be used as a channel where a deeper level of communication among brands, target audiences and fellow attendees can be achieved. More importantly, inventive event ideas and concepts can be translated into more concrete executions.</p>

<p>Most the technological innovations mentioned probably seem too good to be true. There are also important factors that need to be considered when choosing your EventTech. You will need the number of attendees to determine the bandwidth, wearable tech, Wi-Fi stations and tags. Although it may be challenging to embrace and assimilate new devices and more advanced alternatives into traditional event management practices, it doesn’t hurt to learn and improve from it.</p>
