<h4 id="concerns-when-choosing-an-event-app">Concerns when choosing an event app</h4>

<p>When choosing an event app, concerns differ whether attendees are participating virtually or in-person. Let’s break it into details.</p>

<h5 id="for-hybrid-events">For hybrid events:</h5>

<p>A hybrid event is a mashup of an in-person and a virtual event. People can attend either physically at a location or virtually online. But though it may sound very promising, virtual event organizers have these concerns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Will my online attendees face connectivity issues?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Choose an event app with a solid streaming infrastructure. One that can handle high bandwidth demands and still, ensure uninterrupted live streams for virtual attendees. As a contingency plan, choose an app that can also record the live sessions and make them available on-demand.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Will both virtual and in-person attendees have a consistent event experience?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Look for an event app that bridges digital and physical experiences. An app that seamlessly integrates virtual and in-person activities, like as real-time interaction, Q&amp;A sessions, and networking opportunities. The key is both attendees can participate together.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Can I consolidate virtual and in-person data?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>When choosing an event app for hybrid events, the ability to consolidate data from both virtual and in-person sources is important. Consider an event app that provides a single unified data platform to capture and analyze all event data, whether from virtual or in-person sources.</p>

<h5 id="for-in-person-events">For in-person events:</h5>

<p>In-person events, also sometimes called physical events, are the traditional way of holding events. It’s being together in a physical space. Here are the common concerns of in-person event organizers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What if we have poor wifi or internet connectivity at the venue?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Offline capabilities are a must. The conference mobile app should function smoothly even without internet access. Your attendees should still be able to network and pull up essential event info no matter what the connection situation is. Ideally, you can customize which sections or features are available in offline mode.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tqGFEYh0gZ82qQxxFLwgMuUHWxmsS2kZoz8DeTep1f-nPnvDoOKQDTq_FQqJLlggrg9hVU9toKjBwcXVn5P8DEzG0CV9k4a4i_qyDKrzoXR-lBI25Mu4uJwGRqaJ2fEvL8ToVz0ivjTwk4bxTCLJaFc" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What are the onsite support and implementation services?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The mobile event app support team should offer comprehensive onsite support services, technical deployment resources, and hands-on troubleshooting during the event dates themselves. Their professional services and customer support models are important factors.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What costs am I really looking at beyond just subscription fees?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The sticker price is just one piece of the pricing puzzle. You have to understand any extra costs for integrations, premium support, branding, or development work. And whether pricing is per attendee or per event-based.</p>

<p>🔥 <strong><em>If you need a mobile app with transparent pricing plans, **</em></strong><strong>**<a href="../pricing.html">Micepad</a></strong>* is your best choice. Pricing is clear, upfront, and with no hidden fees.***</p>
