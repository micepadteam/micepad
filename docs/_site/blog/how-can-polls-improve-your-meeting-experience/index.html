  <p>If you were around in the events industry many years ago, you will probably be used to something like this if you wanted to conduct a poll.</p>

<p>While effective, voting through one of these keypads not only seems unresponsive as it is a one way communication, it look outdated and clunky.  Managing a large number of devices in a crowd without one of them going missing, getting damaged or not working is also a big logistical issue.</p>

<p>While this technology is still available today, and works perfectly fine, why not go for something more refined, more convenient and a lot cooler! With mobile applications and engagement solutions,<strong> </strong>engaging your audience is simple, quick and in the palm of your attendees!</p>

<p>Using their very own mobile phones, polls can be administered with the results shown live on the screen. This has not only become a handy way to get everyone involved, but also a good way to start a discussion with poll results giving the flow and direction. It is also versatile in it’s uses.</p>

<p>Want to find out what the crowd thinks? Do a poll before your presentation and do another one right after and see the change in their understanding and knowledge.</p>

<p>Not sure of how to carry on the discussion? Plan polls during your panel discussion and use them if you need interesting insights to discuss.</p>

<p>Want to give out a prize? Get the audience to vote for the winner live on screen!</p>

<p>As you can see. a poll can come in handy at several points during your conference. But be sure to never create a poll for the sake of creating one. Doing this might lead to lower participation and resistance to participation as not only does it get repetitive after a while, it might even feel irritating. Don’t turn a positive to a negative. Use it wisely!</p>

<p>Now that you’ve had these insights, how likely are you to use a poll for your next event?</p>

<p>A. Very Likely
B. Likely
C. Not Likely
D. Not At All</p>
