<p>Have you ever heard of crowdsourcing? The difference between formulating your own questions and crowdsourcing the most significant questions related to your event’s main topic, is the latter never fails to captivate genuine participation from your audience. After all, nothing speaks better to an event audience than a personalized and highly interactive event experience.</p>

<p>The creation of an audience <a href="../products/mobile-event-app.html">Q&amp;A and live polling in event apps</a> is perhaps one of the most revolutionizing things to ever happen to the event industry.</p>

<p>Adding a Live Polling and Q&amp;A Board feature in your event means handing your audience the reins of facilitating communication and engagement among fellow attendees. You provide them a strong voice that reflects their personal thoughts and experiences on your event’s key topics and objectives.</p>

<p>There is no better way to measure the success and effectiveness of an event than through seeing it through the eyes and experiences of the attendees. Live Polling in events lets you collect audience opinion and gain instant statistical results for specific questions in real-time. What this means is putting the spotlight on attendee insights to make discussions more thoughtful and connected to how differently participants interpret and absorb the topics you present to them.</p>
