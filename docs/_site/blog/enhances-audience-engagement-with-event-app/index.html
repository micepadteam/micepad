  <p>A recent research study indicated that no less than 60% of marketers involved in event planning and management get better attendee engagement with an <a href="../index.html">event planning software</a>. Of the 40% who do not already use event apps,<a href="https://www.eventmanagerblog.com/event-app-bible">75% of them have the intention of adopting such technology in the future.</a></p>

<p>If this is so, these event apps must be doing something right by organisers. Here are some of those goodies you don’t want to miss out on.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>It’s time to catch up on event app, as they’ve become essential for event planners. Here are the top ways event apps can enhance your event:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replace print media hassles with digital efficiency.</li>
  <li>Provide seamless access to event programs and multimedia resources.</li>
  <li>Boost <a href="/blog/enhances-audience-engagement-with-event-app/">audience engagement</a> through real-time updates and interactive features.</li>
  <li>Increase <a href="event-sponsorship.html">event sponsorship</a> revenue with targeted messaging and engagement opportunities.</li>
  <li>Facilitate clear and timely communication with attendees.</li>
  <li>Foster <a href="event-networking-opportunities-ideas.html">networking</a> and collaboration among participants.</li>
  <li>Incorporate gamification elements for an immersive event experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-an-event-app">What Is An Event App?</h3>

<p>An <a href="../index.html">event app</a> is your go-to tool on your phone or desktop, designed to supercharge your event experience. Consider it like having a personal assistant for events, keeping you updated with schedules, connecting you with other team members, and ensuring you don’t miss a beat on your event preparation.</p>

<p><a href="../products.html">Event management apps</a> transform the daunting processes of <a href="event-planning-challenges-and-solutions.html">event planning</a>, making it easier for organizers to collaborate and for attendees to navigate and engage. They’re not just about convenience in hand; they’re shaping the future of how events bring people together, making them more interactive and connected than ever before.</p>

<h3 id="how-event-app-can-enhance-audience-engagement">How Event App Can Enhance Audience Engagement</h3>

<p>There are ways you can maximize <a href="../index.html">event management software</a> to help you kickstart your next event.</p>

<h4 id="1-eliminating-the-hassles-of-print-media">1. Eliminating the Hassles of Print Media</h4>

<p>Many events are still guilty of using printed programs for their proceedings. While we are not against print media, it might not be the most effective one for you.</p>

<p>With print media, organizers have to worry about things like how…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many copies of the program outline to print</li>
  <li>To effectively manage the resources spent on print media</li>
  <li>To deal with an unplanned change in the program, and so much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>With an event app on your side, you don’t have to worry about that.</p>

<p>Afterall,<a href="https://www.eventmanagerblog.com/event-app-bible?utm_source=EMblog&amp;utm_medium=Post%20announcement&amp;utm_campaign=Post%20Announcement">60% of smartphone users are already using their devices at social gatherings and events</a>, so it wouldn’t hurt to tip your event app into their devices for the duration of your event.</p>

<h4 id="2-better-program-access">2. Better Program Access</h4>

<p>Following from the above, event attendees can get a lot more done from the event app. Besides getting real-time updates on changes to the show at one point or the other, they also get to access multimedia resources (think slides, presentations, clips, videos, materials, etc.) from the event.</p>

<p>Likewise, it becomes much easier for a user to navigate exhibitors, keynote speakers, booths and sections of the event hall, if need be.</p>

<h4 id="3-audience-engagement-boost">3. Audience Engagement Boost</h4>

<p>Your attendee never has to feel left out ever again when they have an event app at hand. With it, they can sync presentation times across their devices to get notified when a choice program is about to get underway.</p>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2019/09/boost-event-audience-engagement-with-event-app-1024x686.webp" alt="boost event audience engagement with event app" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, the event planning software makes it easy to reach out to speakers/ exhibitors with questions and feedback after they must have left the podium. If this is not a great interaction and audience engagement boost to make your event even more successful, we don’t know what is.</p>

<h4 id="4-improve-revenue-for-sponsors">4. Improve Revenue for Sponsors</h4>

<p>The <a href="virtual-events-sponsorship.html">event sponsorship</a> who have dedicated their resources towards the success of your program also hope to gain exposure to all the attendees of the day. You can help them achieve this if you had a dedicated <a href="../products/mobile-event-app.html">custom event app</a> for that event.</p>

<p>Here’s how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app can be downloaded and installed before the event starts at all, giving your sponsors an early foot in the door.</li>
  <li>During the event, your sponsors get to reach out to the attendees with personalized messages and earn better audience engagements (and maybe conversions, as the case may be) from that.</li>
  <li>Following the fact that a huge majority use their smartphones in events, your sponsors can <em>always</em> be <em>actively present</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-seamless-interaction">5. Seamless Interaction</h4>

<p>Clear and timely communication is key at any event, and your <a href="../products/mobile-event-app.html">mobile event app</a> makes it effortless. In today’s world where everyone’s glued to their phones, your app ensures messages are direct and timely, keeping attendees in the loop from start to finish. Push notifications and email alerts keep them informed before and during the event, while event guidelines and updates are just a scroll away.</p>

<h4 id="6-easier-networking-and-collaboration">6. Easier Networking and Collaboration</h4>

<p>Post-pandemic, in-person events are making a strong comeback, emphasizing the importance of networking and forging new connections. Does your event app act just as a tool when it should be able to bridge meaningful interactions? In the Micepad app, we facilitate networking among attendees and boost their return on investment by providing exhibitors and sponsors with personalized platforms to showcase products and engage directly with potential clients.</p>

<h4 id="7-event-apps-gamification">7. Event Apps Gamification</h4>

<p>Events today are all about creating memorable experiences, and event gamification adds a whole new level of excitement to the table. By incorporating elements of challenge, strategy, and competition, your app transforms ordinary events into thrilling adventures that everyone keeps their eyes on. Interactive challenges keeps your attendees engaged and energized, turning your event into an immersive experience they’ll remember long after it’s over.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>

<p>By simply helping you save resources which could be better directed to making other parts of your event a success, boosting potential revenue and outreach for your sponsors while also ensuring a better experience for the attendees, incorporating an event app into your next event, conference, exhibition, seminar, etc. is a no-brainer.</p>
