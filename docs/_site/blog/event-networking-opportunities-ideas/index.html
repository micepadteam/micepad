<p>Oftentimes, the networking part of an event is given the least importance. What most brands and event organizers don’t realize is not all participants are comfortable mingling with people they’ve only met for the first time.</p>

<p>Interactions simply don’t always happen naturally even during gatherings. Audience networking requires a solid structure and plan wherein the event’s objectives are met while convenience and a unique event experience are being implemented.</p>

<p>Transforming your event into a place where solid interpersonal connections can be built can be tricky, but this blog aims to provide a quick but thorough guide on how you can achieve that. Below are networking consideration you can employ for your next event:</p>

<h4 id="1-event-venues-affect-first-impressions-and-first-impressions-determine-attendee-mood">1. Event venues affect first impressions, and first impressions determine attendee mood</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2018/09/Tech-Workshop-Conference-Room-1024x681.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A great venue can spur a positive domino effect from the beginning up to the end of your event. Excellent ambience, lots of room to move around, and locations that are easy to find help entice participants all the more. When attendees find event venues easy to navigate through, this will save them the trouble of having to go over maps or get mixed directions to the location.</p>

<p>Outlining your event’s venue also means choosing the perfect venue that captures what your event is all about. Whether you opt for an outdoor meeting or an in-house gathering in a prestigious banquet hall, rearranging a venue to represent your brand speaks volumes to your attendees.</p>

<h4 id="2-introduce-your-online-community-to-your-participants">2. Introduce your online community to your participants</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2018/09/Tech-Social-Media-Promotion-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having a social media profile for your brand makes it easier to make your event known to your target audience. Let’s say your attendees really clicked during your event and both become avid followers of your brand.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to be the link that keeps them in touch? Using your event to drive higher traffic to your social media page is genius. When paired with your brand’s event, your attendees are presented with an exclusive community where they can engage and continue communicating with fellow attendees even after the end of your event.</p>

<h4 id="3-incentives-are-great-motivational-factors">3. Incentives are great motivational factors</h4>

<p>Networking is also a give-and-take process. You can’t take or expect something from the other party without offering something of equal value in return. When trying to persuade an audience to participate in event activities and interact with fellow participants, sometimes the best way to do so is by recognizing attendee efforts and providing them with incentives in exchange for being cooperative. When you allow them to bask in the spotlight, give them the proper credit and recognition for sharing their ideas. The higher the level of involvement audiences invest in your event, the more likely they are to share their knowledge and experiences with each other.</p>

<h4 id="4-maximize-on-shared-interests-of-your-attendees">4. Maximize on shared interests of your attendees</h4>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2018/09/Tech-Training-and-Workshops-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>People matching is when you pair or group your event attendees together based on things they have in common such as hobbies, interests, or niche. There are several ways by which you can execute an effective people matching activity in your event.</p>

<p>You can have attendees fill out a survey prior to the event to help you sort and group all the answers. Then, on the day of the event, you can have seats arranged based on which attendees share common interests. Another example would be C2 Montreal’s Brain Dating Lounge.</p>

<p>There were matchmakers present during the event and they assisted attendees in finding fellow participants who match their areas of expertise and interest. On the other hand, the Micepad app lets you create introductions for both your participants and your speakers. With customized profiles, attendees gain just the right amount of information they need. It likewise helps make it easier for them to find individuals they would want to interact with.</p>

<h3 id="6-networking-event-concepts-you-shouldnt-miss">6 Networking Event Concepts You Shouldn’t Miss</h3>

<p>Networking events are all about making those meaningful connections. To help you host an unforgettable and engaging event, here are five innovative ideas you should definitely consider:</p>

<h4 id="1-round-table-discussions">1. Round Table Discussions</h4>

<p>Set up round tables throughout your venue for groups to gather and chat about specific topics or just network. These cozy settings encourage face-to-face conversations and let everyone dive deep into discussions. It’s a great way to make sure every voice gets heard and valued, fostering a real sense of community.</p>

<h4 id="2-food-stations">2. Food Stations</h4>

<p>Introduce food stations with unique offerings like donut walls, ice cream bars, or açai bowls. Not only do these stations serve up delicious treats, but they also make excellent conversation starters. Guests can bond over their shared culinary experiences, naturally leading to deeper conversations and potential business opportunities. The casual vibe around food stations helps break the ice and encourages more relaxed interactions.</p>

<h4 id="3-scavenger-hunts">3. Scavenger Hunts</h4>

<p>Organize scavenger hunts where attendees form teams to find items or complete tasks around the venue. This fun, interactive activity encourages teamwork and helps break down social barriers. As participants work together to achieve common goals, they build connections that can lead to lasting professional relationships. Scavenger hunts add a sense of adventure and excitement, making networking both enjoyable and memorable.</p>

<h4 id="4-host-a-panel-or-forum">4. Host A Panel or Forum</h4>

<p>Hosting a panel or forum is a fantastic way to facilitate networking. Panels give guests the chance to ask questions and interact with industry experts while encouraging large group discussions. These sessions allow attendees to engage with each other, sparking conversations that often continue long after the panel ends. It’s a great way to connect guests who might not have interacted otherwise.</p>

<h4 id="5-incorporate-interactive-activity">5. Incorporate Interactive Activity</h4>

<p>Yes, you have an amazing line-up of speakers, a mouth-watering assortment of appetizers and meals, and a breathtaking venue. Yet, you find participants yawning and staring off into space. If you are an attendee and you are made to sit through several seminars, or left to enjoy the event on your own and without any sort of guidance from the organizers, surely you would feel a sense of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>This is because the event lacks a proactive interaction from the audience. Aside from adding an element of fun, icebreakers are highly effective in making attendees feel more comfortable. Icebreakers can either be in the form of a game, a set of questions, or a creative way of having attendees introduce themselves to each other.</p>

<h4 id="6-mobile-event-apps">6. Mobile Event Apps</h4>

<p>Use a <a href="../products/mobile-event-app.html">mobile event app</a> to boost networking opportunities before, during, and after your event. An event app serves as a hub for all event-related info, including tickets, schedules, and networking features. Guests can use the <a href="/products/">event management app</a> to schedule meetings, set up meet-ups, and join live chats. This way, networking doesn’t stop when the event ends, letting attendees continue their conversations and build stronger connections over time.</p>

<p>The beauty of using <a href="../index.html">event apps</a> lies in the wide array of networking features you can choose from for your event. For starters, event apps help make communication quicker and easier. There are apps that can be integrated to social media channels, thereby enabling faster exchange of social media profiles among attendees.</p>

<p>Some event apps employ QR codes to assign unique name badges to attendees and help them exchange contact information in a jiffy. One-on-one private messaging and group chats drive higher audience involvement and more in-depth networking while your event is ongoing.</p>
