<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2021/06/Clutter-Less-is-More.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="trend-1--less-is-more">Trend #1 – Less is More</h4>

<p>Events have grown to a stage where companies now use the size of theirs to outpace one another. While that has worked for some time now, it is time to retire that strategy.</p>

<p>Consumers are continually growing distrust for brands who always want to go big at all times. This means the event planner now has to find a way to plan more intimate, smaller-sized yet impactful events for brands now. That way, meaningful engagement can be made and more achieved altogether.</p>

<h4 id="trend-2--demand">Trend #2 – Demand</h4>

<p>The demand for events has been growing, but we will see even massive growth in 2024.</p>

<p>Brands and their executives are demanding more events by the hour, putting a lot of event planners on their feet. Besides just being on the ground to plan more events in the new year, you also have to be proactive in your bookings.</p>

<p>Since more events are happening all around, waiting to make that booking could cost you more than the basic price. Group discounts for hotels and such other packages should also be sourced and kept handy since you will be needing such frequently now.</p>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2021/06/Personalisation-1.jpeg" alt="personalization for each attendee is one of the most cutting edge event planning trends" /></p>

<h4 id="trend-3--personalisation-on-the-rise">Trend #3 – Personalisation on the Rise</h4>

<p>This is not a trend unique to the event industry, but that does not make it less important here anyway. Interestingly, personalization can be approached in several ways.</p>

<p>It can be anything from creating a special schedule for each attendee at the event based on their personal needs and interests to mapping out a unique floor plan for them. The best thing about this is that data collected from the user (usually when an <a href="../index.html">event app</a> or any other such piece of <a href="/micepad/products/">event management software</a> is involved) can help personalize follow-up mails and modes of contact for better overall customer experience.</p>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2021/06/Event-Venue.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="trend-4--venues-become-flexible">Trend #4 – Venues Become Flexible</h4>

<p>The first point of call for event planners when it comes to the venue is either that big conference hall or some other top-of-the-line location. There is nothing wrong with this, but they are starting to bring one word to mind: boring.</p>

<p>Event planners are now more likely to host their coming events in an unusual location than ever before. The attendees/ consumers demand authenticity and flexibility, and that is what they get with a non-traditional choice of venue.</p>

<p>Interestingly, choosing a great unconventional venue is even a nice way to mentally prompt attendees to take pictures and share their experiences on social media.</p>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2021/06/Work-and-Pleasure.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="trend-5--mixing-business-with-pleasure">Trend #5 – Mixing Business with Pleasure</h4>

<p>It has always been said that business and pleasure do not go well together, but all that is changing rapidly.</p>

<p>Business executives, for one, do not get a lot of time away. Thus, they might not be interested in attending an event if it will only contribute to their stress levels. What they would love, though, is an event being held at a vacation-worthy location.</p>

<p>Even if they would not be spending so much time there, it is a great opportunity to see the place and mentally enter the holiday vibe – even if they are not on vacation. Referred to as Bleisure by some, let that always be at the back of your planning mind too.</p>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2021/06/Event-food.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="trend-6--food-is-key">Trend #6 – Food is Key</h4>

<p>We are at the time and age where everyone is making their choices about everything – from what they choose to wear, how they choose to be identified to how they eat. Speaking of the latter, the vegan population is growing at a rapid pace. If anything, event planners should also grow at the same pace to meet up with their needs.</p>

<p>It will be in your best interest to include a feeding preference section in your event registration process. That way, you don’t offend a group of people by not providing what foods they prefer.</p>

<p><img src="/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2021/06/Event-Security.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="trend-7--security">Trend #7 – Security</h4>

<p>This isn’t a trend so much as it is a requirement. Depending on the event, security may be the most important factor to your event guests. However, even if your event’s requirements are not particularly high, it’s best to have contingencies at hand.</p>

<p>Just a little over half of the event planners have a set plan in place for emergencies, with the rest just leaving things to chance. If you have not thought about it before, the lives and well-being of all those attendees are in your hands, so you should assume responsibility before and when they get to the venue.</p>

<p>From <a href="../products/check-in-app.html">check-in</a> through the event proper to the end of the entire program, always have the security of all attendees to be a paramount concern.</p>

<h4 id="trend-8--improvise">Trend #8 – Improvise</h4>

<p>After the pandemic, everyone thought event planning would be brimming with fresh, exciting ideas. But surprisingly, many events have just gone back to their old ways. Holding onto these old methods can make events feel outdated and dull, which isn’t what today’s audiences want.</p>

<p>If you want your events to be a hit, it’s time to switch things up. Pick venues that not only attract but also excite your attendees to boost <a href="increase-event-engagement.html">event engagement</a>. Use the latest <a href="event-technology-trends.html">event technology</a> to encourage real-time interactions and create sponsorship packages that offer real value to both sponsors and attendees.</p>

<p>Mix up your session formats to boost engagement and choose speakers who truly connect with your crowd. Leverage social media for promotion and focus on post-event engagement to keep the buzz going. By making these changes, you’ll keep your events fresh, dynamic, and something people look forward to attending.</p>

<h4 id="trend-9--artificial-intelligence">Trend #9 – Artificial Intelligence</h4>

<p>AI has changed the game in event planning. With tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Bard, you can automate those time-consuming tasks and focus more on the creative and strategic side of things.</p>

<p>In the future, you’ll see even more AI being used in the industry. These tools will get better at helping you serve your attendees and predict future trends for things like hotel group sales. AI can help you target potential attendees and anticipate changes in demand, making your event planning smarter and more efficient.</p>

<p>But remember, while AI is super helpful, you still need to use it wisely. Always double-check the information it gives you and never share confidential data with it. Use AI to enhance your strategy, not as your only source of information.</p>

<h4 id="trend-10--go-hybrid">Trend #10 – Go Hybrid</h4>

<p>The event landscape is changing, especially with Millennials and Gen Z making up a big part of the population. They want more freedom upon what they can do with their time and money.</p>

<p>Hybrid events are perfect for meeting these needs by combining in-person and virtual experiences. This not only expands your reach but also ensures everyone can participate, no matter where they are. This increases your event’s accessibility and potential audience size, meaning even those who can’t travel due to distance, health issues, or financial reasons can still participate and enjoy your event.</p>

<p>Having both in-person and virtual options gives your attendees the freedom to choose how they want to join, boosting attendance and engagement because people can pick what works best for them. You can also elevate the experience for the in-person events  by trying services like <a href="https://sgpad.com/ipad-rental/">iPad rental</a>.</p>

<p>These events can also use technology to make the experience more engaging and interactive for everyone. With features like live polls, Q&amp;A sessions, and virtual networking rooms, hybrid events ensure that everyone, no matter how they attend, can actively participate and feel involved. This flexibility and inclusivity not only enhance the overall experience but also create a sense of community among all attendees, making hybrid events a trend that’s here to stay.</p>
