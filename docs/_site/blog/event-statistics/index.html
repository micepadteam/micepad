  <p style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">July 17, 2024</p>
  
  <p>It is one thing to always talk about why event management applications are the next best thing for event planners – but are there hard facts, numbers, or event statistics to back it up?</p>

<p>That is a valid question to ask especially for new planners in the business – or those who would like to branch into the <a href="../products.html">event apps</a> scene. Rather than just pour out a lot of personal sentiments as to why these event apps are great, we let the stats take the stage today.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>Event apps are crucial for your 2024 strategy because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global Mobile Reach</strong>: Nearly everyone uses smartphones globally.</li>
  <li><strong>High Engagement</strong>: Users check their phones frequently, boosting interaction with event apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive ROI</strong>: 91% of event planners see a positive return on investment using event apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Increased Engagement</strong>: Apps generate 42% more engagement than traditional methods.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-the-trend-for-events-t-in-2024-and-beyond">What is the Trend for Events t in 2024 and Beyond?</h3>

<p>The event scene is buzzing with some really cool changes, and it’s all thanks to digitalization. This tech boost has made event production way more efficient and cost-effective in the U.S., and it’s even becoming a popular alternative to traditional in-person gatherings, according to Future Market Insights.</p>

<p>But that’s not all! There’s a growing trend in experiential marketing. <a href="https://hubspot.com/state-of-marketing">HubSpot’s 2024 State of Marketing Report</a> says that 16% of marketers are planning to dive into this for the first time this year. So, expect to see more pop-ups and live events designed to create memorable, real-life experiences for audiences.</p>

<p>And here’s the cherry on top: <strong>event pros are super optimistic about the future</strong>. The AmEx Global Meetings and Events Forecast for 2023 reveals that 63% of them believe we’ll see attendee numbers bouncing back to pre-pandemic levels in the next year or two. This is awesome news, as it means more people are looking forward to attending and enjoying events again.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the event industry is set to thrive with a mix of digital innovations and hands-on experiences. You’re going to love the blend of virtual convenience and the irreplaceable charm of face-to-face interactions. Exciting times ahead!</p>

<h3 id="why-are-event-apps-trending">Why Are Event Apps Trending?</h3>

<p>Events are really heating up in 2024, with 86.4% of event organizers planning to keep or even increase the number of in-person events this year compared to 2023, according to Bizzabo’s 2023 report. This means more events are happening, and you can bet more people are going to show up, all expecting these events to be valuable.</p>

<p>In-person events are still a big hit. In fact, 70% of attendees say they’re the best for training and professional content, as <a href="https://www.freeman.com/resources/freeman-trends-report-q1-2024/">Freeman’s 2024</a> data shows. These events aren’t just about learning, though. They’re prime opportunities for networking, with 81% of attendees eager to connect with experts and 68% excited to meet new people.</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk about a key trend that’s been making waves to this trend: <a href="how-event-app-can-reduce-event-costs.html">event apps</a>. Event planners have been relying on these apps for a while now to ensure everything runs smoothly. From managing registrations to coordinating schedules and gathering feedback, these apps help make events mistake-free and highly manageable. They’re a big reason why events can meet the high expectations of attendees who want memorable experiences from registration up to the closing and aftersales.</p>

<p>So, with more events in the future, you can look forward to a mix of valuable content, seamless and easy networking opportunities, and perfectly executed gatherings, all thanks to the trusty event apps that planners have been using to keep everything on track.</p>

<h3 id="event-statistics-on-event-apps-in-the-event-industry">Event Statistics On Event Apps in The Event Industry</h3>

<h4 id="stat-1--user-base">Stat #1 – User Base</h4>

<p>The year 2025 is almost upon us, and event planners are looking to make a maximum impact. As the new decade turns, we are also expecting to have <a href="https://www.coolest-gadgets.com/smartphone-statistics">no less than 7.13 billion users of smartphone units</a> from all around the world.</p>

<p>That is just a few billions shy of the global population, so we can almost say that just about the whole world is on mobile. Now that you know your audience is on mobile, why would you not try to reach them with, say, applications?</p>

<h4 id="stat-2--usage-stats">Stat #2 – Usage Stats</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/smartphone-addiction/">The average mobile user looks at their phone 63 times</a> over a full day,  and this is just on average!. This number can climb way higher from person to person.  What’s even more interesting is the fact that smartphone users are whipping out their devices at almost every activity they do including social gatherings and events according to <a href="https://business.yougov.com/content/47430-at-concerts-sports-events-or-the-cinema-when-are-consumers-most-likely-to-whip-their-phones-out">YouGov</a>. This means that if you had an app for that social gathering, you will also be getting a fraction of all that digital attention whenever they take their eyes off the main event.</p>

<h4 id="stat-3--return-on-investment">Stat #3 – Return on Investment</h4>

<p>One of the biggest drivers of any business is the ROI that comes with it. In short, a business strategy with a poor ROI is best dumped in favor of another.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is interesting to note that an impressive <a href="https://blog.bizzabo.com/event-apps-guide">91% of event planners</a> have recorded ROI in the positive lane when they chose to use event planning software and applications. It would ultimately  make sense for you to take what works from those who have tried it and start the game with that too so that you always have a foot forward in the market from the onset.</p>

<h4 id="stat-4--impressions">Stat #4 – Impressions</h4>

<p>One of the key performance indicators of event success is in the kind of reach, coverage, and impressions it gains on and off the web. While we can discuss offline impressions another day, mobile event apps make it possible to get <a href="https://blog.printsome.com/event-app-engagement/">42% more engagement</a> than if they weren’t used at all.</p>

<h4 id="stat-5--adoption">Stat #5 – Adoption</h4>

<p>According to a <a href="https://amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/press-room/american-express-gbt-meetings-events-2024-global-forecast-internal-meetings-and-artificial-intelligence-accelerate-industry-growth/">research by American Express</a>**, **mobile apps being a staple in meetings and events is predicted to have a usage rate of 60%. The research also goes on to show that the adoption of this piece of technology to run events is on the rise, and you might as well get in on it or be left out when full adoption happens.</p>

<h4 id="stat-6--ticketing">Stat #6 – Ticketing</h4>

<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/external/event-statistics/image1.png" alt="event statistics from statista" /></p>

<p>The chart from <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/891056/event-ticket-online-users-by-segment-worldwide">Statista</a> shows a positive trend in the number of online users purchasing event tickets worldwide from 2021 to 2028. The increasing numbers indicate that more people are turning to online platforms to secure their spots at events.</p>

<p>While that is a nice development, people are also getting wary of releasing their credit card details online for the fear of breaches. You can quell such fears when you have a dedicated app for that event from which attendees can make ticket payments.This, in turn, increases the attendance rate than if you were just using a generic platform to handle the ticket sales.</p>

<h4 id="stat-7--attendee-satisfaction">Stat #7 – Attendee Satisfaction</h4>

<p>After all that’s said and done, the aim of events is not only to put forward  the items on the agenda for the day, but also ensure that  attendees are well treated too. For that reason, it is heartening  to note  that <a href="https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/event-management-software-features">a study by Bizaboo</a> showed that about 72.5% of organizers believe that their event management platform played a crucial role in the success of their latest event, which is crucial in the attendee experience and satisfaction.  .</p>

<h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3>
