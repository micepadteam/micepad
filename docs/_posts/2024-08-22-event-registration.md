### How To Set Up Registration for An Event

Planning and setting up registration processes can significantly impact the overall success and organisation of your event.  Here’s  9 simple steps along with some [event registration tips](event-registration-tips.html) that you can follow along when setting up your  event registration.

#### 1. Pre-Event Registration

Pre-event registration lets you sign up for the event ahead of time. During this process, you can gather your attendees details, allow them to secure their spots before the event, and confirm their attendance.

#### 2. The Event Registration Form

When you design your registration form, make sure it’s user-friendly and fits your event’s vibe by considering some aspects:

- **Look and Feel**: Your form should look good and be easy to navigate so you get the first impression right.
- **Customisation**: Tailor the form to collect all the info you need—from basic contact details to specific preferences and payments. This flexibility caters to everyone, whether they’re regular attendees or VIPs.
- **Mobile-Friendliness**: Since most people register on their phones, make sure your form works seamlessly on mobile devices.

#### 3. Registration Form Accuracy & Validation

Another thing to pay attention to is how to ensure your registration data is accurate, here’s the doable tips to tackle this challenge:

- **Essential Details**: Use mandatory fields to gather crucial information and avoid duplicates, keeping your attendee list clear and accurate.
- **Data Checks**: Incorporate validation checks to verify entries like email formats and addresses. This prevents fake registrations and keeps your data organised and reliable.
- **Understanding Your Audience**: Ask demographic questions to learn more about your attendees. Tracking this info helps you fine-tune your marketing to reach the right people effectively.
- **Co-Branded Pages**: Partnering with exhibitors on registration pages not only boosts event visibility but also provides advanced tracking features, benefiting both sides.

#### 4. Badge Types and Printing Options

Now that we’re diving into onsite registration, let’s talk badges! Choosing the right badge type and how you print them can make a big difference in how smoothly your event runs. Here are some of the most common [badge printing](https://sgpad.com/event-registration/) options:

- **PDF Badges (Print at Home)**: This is a game-changer for skipping those long registration lines. Once you register online, you get an email with your badge ready to print. Pro Tip: Send a friendly reminder closer to the event date so everyone remembers to bring their badge with them.
- **Postal Badges**: These are pre-printed and mailed out, adding a personal touch but remember, they can cost a bit more due to postage. Save them for your VIPs or special groups.
- **Pre-Printed Badges**: Perfect for smaller events where you can hand out badges as people arrive. Keeps things moving and reduces the need for extra staff.
- **Plastic Card ID Badges**: These are like your event’s VIP pass. They’re durable, personalised with photos, and add extra security—great for more exclusive events.

#### 5. Onsite Badge Accessories, Are They Needed?

Yes, they are! To help the networking activity easier, you may also accessorise those badges to make sure everyone can easily show who they are:

- **Badge Holders**: Essential for badges that don’t stick on their own or for those printed at home. You can get them in different colors to help spot different groups.
- **Lanyards**: These are super handy for wearing badges around your neck. They make it easy to spot who’s who and keep your hands free for networking.

#### 6. Exhibitor Badging and QR Codes

Don’t forget about making sure your exhibitors are sorted and using tech to keep things running smoothly with at least these two essentials event registration software features:

- **Exhibitor Badging**: Exhibitors need badges too! They can register online just like attendees and pick up their badges on the day. Keep an eye on how many badges they need to avoid surprises.
- **Barcode / QR Codes**: Each badge gets its own unique code that links back to the attendee’s details. This makes checking people quick and accurate, which everyone loves.

#### 7. Onsite Terminals for Registration

Onsite terminals play a crucial role in managing registrations efficiently during events and last minute changes:

- **Self-Service and Staffed Terminals**: Attendees who haven’t pre-registered can use self-service terminals to print and collect their badges on the spot. Staffed terminals are also available to assist and expedite the registration process.
- **Query Terminals**: These customer service terminals help attendees with registration issues like lost badges or confirmation emails. Staff assist in recovering badges and handling onsite payments or visitor vetting.
- **Badge Collection Terminals**: Used for badges not pre-printed, attendees retrieve their badges using confirmation emails with QR codes or reference numbers for quick printing.

#### 8. Staffing and Management

Managing onsite operations is crucial for a seamless event experience. Using QR code  scanning at entrances, for instance, allows you to track attendee entry rates in real-time, which helps in managing the flow of visitors. Similarly, scanning attendees before they enter seminar sessions ensures that these sessions run smoothly without any hitches.

Adequate staffing, provided by registration services, is another essential aspect as it allows your internal teams to concentrate on interacting with visitors and building relationships rather than getting bogged down in logistical tasks.

An experienced onsite [event manager](event-manager.html) plays a pivotal role in overseeing event preparations and staff responsibilities, ensuring everything runs efficiently and that your attendees leave satisfied. Additionally, trained Front of House (FOH) staff are key to managing registrations, handling queues, and providing top-notch customer service during large events, which significantly enhances the visitor experience through professional and courteous service.
