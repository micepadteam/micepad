### How Has Event Engagement Changed in The Past Few Years?

Over the past few years, event engagement has taken a leap into the digital age, shaking things up in some pretty exciting ways that every digital planner needs to keep up with the waves.

First off, remember those times when events were just about showing up, listening, and maybe networking a bit? Well, now it’s all about getting involved and creating a lasting connection. Attendees aren’t just passive anymore, they are now active participants who want to be considered as a part of a certain community, thanks to social media and [event apps](../index.html). You have probably noticed how hashtags have become a big deal at events. Whether it’s posting pictures, commenting, or checking out what others are saying, the whole purpose is to turn events into a live, interactive feed that will foster bigger opportunities.

### Strategies Event Managers Use To Boost Audience Engagement

Let’s find out what strategies are used by event managers to boost their event engagement

#### 1. Invest in Key Speakers

The choice of key speaker you make for the event goes a long way to determine how engaged the acne will be too.

People will be more willing to listen to Jeff Bezos on business matters than they would listen to Lionel Messi. Even though both men are successful in their fields, charisma is not alone to woo a sophisticated audience.

Thus, make sure your key speaker is an authority figure who has some sort of celebrity status and knows what they are saying too.

#### 2. Hold Live Polls

Don’t wait for the event to be over before you stage live polls.

This is one of the reasons why we always recommend building an app for the event, allowing the audience to get engaged with the program this way. An alternative will be to develop a website for the event or create a poll on a social media platform that many of the attendees are on.

Polls are a great way to make the audience feel and know that you value the feedback you get from them, not just the content you throw their way. At the same time, polls can help you finetune the user experience right there within the event by leveraging the feedback you get.

#### 3. Create A Hashtag

Want to know why hashtags work so much?

It creates the feeling of exclusivity to those in the event as they can discuss on open social media awhile having some sort of clique that they belong to. Besides that, hashtags are also a great way for people to find each other on social media which could be the start of some effective [networking opportunities](event-networking-opportunities-ideas.html).

That, and we have not mentioned how it allows just about everyone to get in on the conversation, share their ideas, tweet their opinions and put their mind out there.

In short, you have provided a platform for those who could not speak in the event hall to voice out their thoughts too.

#### 4. Run Contests

We have come to find out that no matter how small the prize is, people are willing to engage in a contest to win it. All you have to do is package the contest beautifully and present it in the right way, and you have already an audience for it.

This means you don’t have to put a hole in your pocket all because you’d like to engage the audience. Get something simple which your attendees will like – possibly in multiple units – and give it out at certain points of the event.

A great way to ensure everyone stays alert, don’t you agree?

#### 5. Share Highlights

Audience engagement does not just happen when the event is on, but when it is done too.

In this case, you can share moments and highlights from the event on social media and ask people to tag themselves. This makes it fun since everyone would want to go through your timeline to see where they were captured, or get mentioned by someone who recognizes them from the frame.

At the same time, you can give the option for interested attendees to download their highlights from an online cloud storage folder.

#### 6. Host An After Party

Let’s face it:

Most events are serious, and even while people are trying to be social, they have to do so as formally as they can. Likewise, attendees restricted to certain codes of conduct and forms of approach.

Once the event proper is done, host an afterparty to allow every one to loosen up and have fun the right way. Those who are more comfortable in this setting will find it easier to network. Others will also have a more relaxed atmosphere to not only have fun but meet new people too.

That is not to mention the fact that the afterparty might be the single reason why many come to your event – especially if it’s a corporate one. After all, these executives have also been looking for an excuse to let off some steam for a while now.

#### 7. Leverage Technology

The amazing part of this is how technology can be used for just about any kind of event.

For some, you could implement exhibition booths for start-ups to showcase what they have on offer. Besides the engagement and fun that gives the audience, you can also make money off booths while offering the start-ups/ other exhibitors a solid platform.

At some other events, game rooms can also be set up to allow attendees to have fun during breaks. Here, immersive 3D technology, AR and VR can be put to good use. Depending on your audience and kind of event, research the forms of technology that will work wonders for you.

#### 8. Networking-Oriented Workshops

When it comes to events, networking is a big deal. You know how intimidating it can be to strike up conversations, especially if you’re new. To center your events around networking, you may want to try some of these strategies:

- **Speed-networking:** Quick rounds of introductions to break the ice.
- **Coffee chats:** Informal meet-ups over coffee to connect in a relaxed setting.
- **Attendee matchmaking:** AI tools that pair your attendees with like-minded folks.
- **Live chats:** Real-time messaging to keep conversations flowing.
- **Mobile apps:** Features that help your audience network before, during, and after the event.

Further, you can make sure your audience isn’t just passively listening but actively engaged by adding some fun activities to your event. Have you ever heard of the Brick Building Activation Challenge? It is one of creative ways to get everyone connecting and thinking outside the box using Legos. Also, breaking out into small group activities can turn your event into a lively and interactive experience, sparking great discussions and making it more memorable for everyone.

#### 9. Customized Event Invitations

Getting a personalized invite makes you feel special, right? As event managers, you must know how to address this by getting your hands on to these two approaches:

- Personalized Communication: Send tailored emails, texts, and updates to keep your participants in the loop.
- Registration Websites: Easy-to-use sites where your audience can sign up hassle-free.

By making them feel valued from the start, you have made sure they are excited about the event.

#### 10. Carefully Craft The Stage and Screens

To keep your audience engaged, it’s essential to focus on what happens on stage and on the screens. Use live polls to ask what matters most to them before and during the event, keeping things interesting and relevant. Mix in performances, videos, and surprises to make your presentations more engaging. Effective moderation by skilled hosts ensures discussions stay lively and on track. Working with AV professionals can elevate your event with high-quality production, making everything look and sound top-notch.

Great speakers and panelists are essential for a successful event, as they captivate the audience, convey key messages, and inspire action. To ensure they deliver impactful talks, provide clear briefings, offer content guidance, and arrange rehearsals with constructive feedback.

#### 11. Live Social Wall

Ever seen those walls at events that show live social media updates? These social walls facilitate real-time interaction by featuring your audience’s posts and photos, allowing everyone to join the conversation. They also help expand the event’s reach, sharing the experience with a wider audience. Additionally, social walls create sponsorship opportunities, enabling brands to get involved and boost event support.

You can also use AI to keep the social wall dynamic and relevant. AI-powered features filter posts to ensure the content remains interesting and on-topic. Personalization options allow the wall to be customized to fit the event’s vibe, while moderation tools ensure only the best content makes it on screen.

By using these two strategies, you can be the event manager who prioritizes your audience to be the key part of the experience, connecting with others and enjoying every moment.

#### 12. Engage in Discussion with Influencers

Teaming up with influencers can really boost your event’s profile and draw in a bigger crowd. These folks already have a loyal following and can bring a fresh perspective to your event. Here’s how you can get the most out of this strategy:

- **Find the Right Influencers**: Look for influencers whose followers match your event’s audience. Their content should vibe with your event’s theme and goals.
- **Invite Them to Participate**: Get influencers involved as speakers, panelists, or moderators. Their insights and ability to engage with attendees can add huge value.
- **Set Up Interactive Sessions**: Plan Q&A sessions, interviews, or live discussions where influencers can chat directly with your audience. This makes the event more interactive and memorable.
- **Use Social Media**: Have influencers promote your event on their social media channels. They can share behind-the-scenes content, event updates, and personal shout-outs to build excitement and drive engagement.
- **Create Exclusive Content**: Work with influencers to create exclusive content like blogs, vlogs, or podcasts leading up to the event. This gives valuable insights and generates buzz.

Getting influencers involved not only attracts their followers but also adds diverse perspectives and lively interactions, making your event more engaging and fun for everyone.

#### 13. Themed Photo Booth

A themed photo booth at your event where everyone can snap fun photos with props and backdrops that match your event’s vibe can be a bang. Encourage your attendees to share their photos using your event’s branded hashtag on social media. This way, you can turn your attendees into walking advertisements, showing off how awesome your event is and drawing in more people who want to be part of the fun.

#### 14. Swag Bags

Who doesn’t love a goodie bag? Swag bags are a hit because they’re filled with goodies like branded mugs, cool gadgets, and exclusive discounts that attendees can take home. Swag bags can be a way to thank your attendees and keep your event fresh in their minds.

For the tech-savvy crowd, consider digital swag bags with virtual coupons and special offers they can access right from their phones. Partnering with brands to personalize these gifts adds a nice touch, reinforcing your event’s brand and making attendees feel appreciated.

#### 15. Wellness Breaks

Let’s face it, sitting through hours of sessions can be draining. That’s why wellness breaks are a game-changer. Mix things up with activities like Yoga, Zumba, or even just a stroll to refresh and recharge attendees.

Another way, you can try setting up quiet zones with comfy seating and relaxing vibes for those who need a breather. And for virtual events, don’t forget to schedule regular breaks to combat screen fatigue. A little downtime goes a long way in keeping everyone engaged and ready to dive back into the action.
