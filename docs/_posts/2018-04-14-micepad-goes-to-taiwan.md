It’s been a dream of ours for quite some time to expand our operations overseas. After months of planning and preparation, we are very excited to inform you on our expansion and new office in Taiwan!

Earlier last month, Micepad CEO, Tan Jie Hao and Business Development Executive, Eunice Low headed over to Taiwan to assist in the final preparations and set up our Taiwan Branch.

With the experience of Kevin, Maggie and Shawn, who has been in Taiwan’s MICE Industry the past several years, we are all set to take the market by storm and revolutionised the way meetings are done.

All the best to our Taiwan team!
