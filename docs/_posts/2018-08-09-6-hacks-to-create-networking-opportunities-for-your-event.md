This is because the event lacks a proactive interaction from the audience. Aside from adding an element of fun, icebreakers are highly effective in making attendees feel more comfortable. [Icebreakers can either be in the form of a game](../products/mobile-event-app.html), a set of questions, or a creative way of having attendees introduce themselves to each other.

Networking is also a give-and-take process. You can’t take or expect something from the other party without offering something of equal value in return. When trying to persuade an audience to participate in event activities and interact with fellow participants, sometimes the best way to do so is by recognizing attendee efforts and providing them with incentives in exchange for being cooperative. When you allow them to bask in the spotlight, give them the proper credit and recognition for sharing their ideas. The higher the level of involvement audiences invest in your event, the more likely they are to share their knowledge and experiences with each other.
