### Event Statistics On Event Apps in The Event Industry

#### Stat #1 – User Base

The year 2025 is almost upon us, and event planners are looking to make a maximum impact. As the new decade turns, we are also expecting to have [no less than 7.13 billion users of smartphone units](https://www.coolest-gadgets.com/smartphone-statistics) from all around the world.

That is just a few billions shy of the global population, so we can almost say that just about the whole world is on mobile. Now that you know your audience is on mobile, why would you not try to reach them with, say, applications?

#### Stat #2 – Usage Stats

[The average mobile user looks at their phone 63 times](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/smartphone-addiction/) over a full day,  and this is just on average!. This number can climb way higher from person to person.  What’s even more interesting is the fact that smartphone users are whipping out their devices at almost every activity they do including social gatherings and events according to [YouGov](https://business.yougov.com/content/47430-at-concerts-sports-events-or-the-cinema-when-are-consumers-most-likely-to-whip-their-phones-out). This means that if you had an app for that social gathering, you will also be getting a fraction of all that digital attention whenever they take their eyes off the main event.

#### Stat #3 – Return on Investment

One of the biggest drivers of any business is the ROI that comes with it. In short, a business strategy with a poor ROI is best dumped in favor of another.

Therefore, it is interesting to note that an impressive [91% of event planners](https://blog.bizzabo.com/event-apps-guide) have recorded ROI in the positive lane when they chose to use event planning software and applications. It would ultimately  make sense for you to take what works from those who have tried it and start the game with that too so that you always have a foot forward in the market from the onset.

#### Stat #4 – Impressions

One of the key performance indicators of event success is in the kind of reach, coverage, and impressions it gains on and off the web. While we can discuss offline impressions another day, mobile event apps make it possible to get [42% more engagement](https://blog.printsome.com/event-app-engagement/) than if they weren’t used at all.

#### Stat #5 – Adoption

According to a [research by American Express](https://amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/press-room/american-express-gbt-meetings-events-2024-global-forecast-internal-meetings-and-artificial-intelligence-accelerate-industry-growth/)**, **mobile apps being a staple in meetings and events is predicted to have a usage rate of 60%. The research also goes on to show that the adoption of this piece of technology to run events is on the rise, and you might as well get in on it or be left out when full adoption happens.

#### Stat #6 – Ticketing

![event statistics from statista](../wp-content/uploads/external/event-statistics/image1.png)

The chart from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/891056/event-ticket-online-users-by-segment-worldwide) shows a positive trend in the number of online users purchasing event tickets worldwide from 2021 to 2028. The increasing numbers indicate that more people are turning to online platforms to secure their spots at events.

While that is a nice development, people are also getting wary of releasing their credit card details online for the fear of breaches. You can quell such fears when you have a dedicated app for that event from which attendees can make ticket payments.This, in turn, increases the attendance rate than if you were just using a generic platform to handle the ticket sales.

#### Stat #7 – Attendee Satisfaction

After all that’s said and done, the aim of events is not only to put forward  the items on the agenda for the day, but also ensure that  attendees are well treated too. For that reason, it is heartening  to note  that [a study by Bizaboo](https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/event-management-software-features) showed that about 72.5% of organizers believe that their event management platform played a crucial role in the success of their latest event, which is crucial in the attendee experience and satisfaction.  .

### Final Thought

With all these positive trends and impressive event statistics, it’s a no-brainer for event planners and organizations to start using a reliable [event management system](../index.html) and app. The number of people buying event tickets online is soaring, and a big chunk of organizers say that their success is thanks to these digital platforms. By hopping on this trend, you can make your processes smoother, give attendees a better experience, and ensure your events go off without a hitch.
