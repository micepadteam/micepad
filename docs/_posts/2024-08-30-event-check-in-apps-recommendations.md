Even though it might seem minor, the check-in stage can set the tone for your entire event. A rocky start can leave your attendees feeling less enthusiastic for the rest of the day. That’s why picking the right check-in app is crucial. With the best check-in apps, you can ensure a smooth, efficient entry that keeps everyone excited and engaged. Let’s dive into the top 15 free and paid event check-in apps that come with interactive features to make your event seamless and memorable.

### First of all, What Is An Event Check-In App? Do You Really Need One?

Imagine the hassle of using pen and paper to check in hundreds of attendees—long lines, potential mistakes, and a lot of lost time. Nightmare, isn’t it? Event check-in apps are here to change that game entirely. These digital tools streamline the entire process, moving you from a cumbersome manual system to an efficient, tech-driven approach.

So, what exactly does an event check-in app do? It simplifies registrations by automating the check-in process, reducing human error, and cutting down on those frustrating long queues. With real-time insights, you can instantly see how many guests have arrived and gauge the popularity of different sessions that are currently happening.

Check-in apps also boost security with features like data encryption and compliance with payment standards, keeping your information safe from breaches. Plus, they allow for on-the-spot badge printing, so you don’t have to worry about errors or misprints with pre-printed badges.

But the benefits don’t stop there. Using an event check-in app also means reduced costs. Do you want to spend less money on staffing, printing, and hardware? With options to check in via QR codes or NFC tech, the process is fast and smooth, leaving your team free to focus on giving guests a warm welcome. Instead of just managing the checking in as the name represents, check-in apps also handle session management and lead collection.

If you’re ready to streamline your event check-in process and elevate your guest experience, then you’re in the right place! Let’s dive into our curated list of the 15 best check-in apps.

- “The Taiwan team is really willing to provide the best solution for Schroders even though the requirements are quite difficult.” – G2

#### Cons

#### Key Features

- **QR-Based Event Check-In**

- **Synced Check-in Tech and Registration for Payment**

Automatically sync online registration data with the event check-in app to ensure tickets are paid. This integration ensures a seamless transition from registration to check-in, enhancing the attendee experience.
- **Reporting and Data Visualisation**

Keeping track of attendance and accessing vital event data can be challenging during onsite events. However, with the right event technology and check-in apps, data analytics and reporting become much more manageable and insightful.

#### Pros

- UX for booth reps and attendees. It’s so simple! I’ve also appreciated the hands-on support and responsiveness of our Project Manager. – CFP Board Spring 2024 Virtual Career Fair
- They are constantly improving their products and services. The ease of creating our virtual job fair is second to none. – G2

#### Cons

- I disliked needing to set up mobile and desktop controls separately, for the virtual environment, but I understood why it was set up that way. I hope in the future the system can automatically adapt or allow you to check boxes from one control area for if something is accessible from both desktop and the mobile app. I also hope the registration platform gets enhanced and becomes part of the dashboard in the future and can support more dynamic form functions. – Anonymous at G2

### 3. Eventify

Create and share personalised forms for attendees, exhibitors, speakers, and sponsors, ensuring a streamlined and organised registration process.

#### Pros

- “Having everything combined in one place and app and being able to interlink everything (agenda, speakers, locations, etc.). Also the affordability of a whitelabel solution that is listed as a standalone app in the app-stores. Great and fast support whenever we had a request. Easy to implement and customise with an intuitive online interface, also able to manage multiple admin users editing at the same time.” – Philipp K. at G2

#### Cons

- The app got slow on the participant overview when a certain number of users was reached. This unfortunately led to long waiting times when trying to find a specific person on the app. Also we encountered some edge-cases in the backend where we would have wished for some more polishing. However nothing was too problematic, it was still by far the best solution we had for our yearly summit (since 2016) yet. – Philipp K. at G2

#### Pricing

Pricing details are available by request and are customised to fit the specific needs of your event, ensuring you get the best value for your requirements.

### 4. Cvent

- The system is pretty much easy to figure out for the early 30s and younger group as we’ve grown up with computers and have typically become proficient with figuring out how to navigate programs. There are a lot of options and templates that allow you to quickly put together a website that houses basic information. – Julie Michelle D at G2

#### Cons

- In presentations to sell the Cvent service, there are several graphics and options shown that require the use of a graphics designer or one of their specialists at $150/hour. I’d have respected the company more if they only showed what their site could do alone.

#### Pricing

#### Pros

- I used Whova for the first time at a conference this summer. From the ease of downloading and set-up using pre-populated data from my organisation profile import to the in-meeting, in-session usage of the app’s features, it was wonderful to have everything I could have needed to access in an easy-to-find and accessible singular place. – Jamie G. at G2

#### Cons

- Probably need a few more capture points for visitors on registration. Should make registration fields mandatory so they are unabled to progress to the next field without completing. – Tracey C. at G2

#### Pricing

Whova’s pricing is tailored to the specific needs of your event, so you will need to request a quote to get detailed pricing information.

#### Pros

- We’ve used Certain for years and one of the great things is the low turnover with account management and tech support. We have been able to adapt the application for all our events of all sizes and types. I like best that I can figure most things out myself, but they’ve been quick to reply and assist as needed. I love the integration with the mobile app platform Touchpoint. That was a game changer for us too. – Janell S. at G2

#### Cons

- There are a few limitations with the platform that would make our experience better, including expanded API functionality, capabilities of the Touchpoint streaming platform, and implementation of abstract management / call for speakers/papers. – G2

#### Pricing

### 8. SplashThat

![splash that](/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2024/08/splash-that.jpg)

The Splash Host mobile app is tailored for checking in event attendees onsite, offering organisers the ability to register walk-ins and print badges in bulk.

It collects RSVPs, lets you set event caps, and reduces manual tracking. Mobile Check-in App: The mobile check-in app makes on-site events much smoother, and helps paper guest lists and enhances efficiency during the event check-in process. – Kate R at G2

#### Cons

- The support is good, but I do wish we had more immediate response to questions or troubleshooting. I get that this is tough to scale and I believe more premium packages offer quicker support, but sometimes we’re in a bind and just need some simple guidance. – G2

#### Pricing

We also would have liked to see better post-use stats to see where the improvements needed to be made. We also felt like there needed to be better design functionality. The pricing for the software is more than other event invitation softwares and over our budget. – Josie M. at G2

#### Pricing

### 15. Eventx

![eventx](/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2024/08/eventx.webp)

Avoid lengthy check-in queues with Eventx! Their efficient event app enables quick entry through QR codes. You can personalise event badges, print them on demand, and enhance attendee engagement with an interactive event experience right from the app.

- **Self Kiosk Check-in:** Attendees can independently check in using self-service kiosks, reducing wait times and staffing needs.

#### Pros

- I like how daily check-in of your registered or walk-in attendees is one of the easiest ways to find out using the EventX check-in application. The check-in EventX application prepares pocket wifi, an Ipad, and a printer through which attendees from the event list are selected and with their name badge, a printout will come along. – Janavi R at G2
- The EventX product was easily accessible to me. I, as a host of the event, was able to get control of my event. – Kerstin H at G2

#### Cons

- A few steps required to add event calendar to outlook for corporate email users. Magic link was difficult to understand at first and registrants did not complete registration,hence, need to manually imported list at the end. – Pongsupa W at G2
- The EventX product does not provide me with proper management of my events, what feature will play a key role during my whole event, and how and when I will guide my attendees about it! – Kawi C at G2
