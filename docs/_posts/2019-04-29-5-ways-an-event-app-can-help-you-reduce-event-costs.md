#### 1. Printing

As [previously mentioned](event-apps-are-they-worth-your-budget.html), you can eliminate all printing costs for your event by uploading your content and material onto your app. Not only is it more accessible, guests are also far less likely to forget to bring their phone than their event program sheet.

*Protip: you can also get a registration app to reduce check-in time or “I forgot to bring my ticket” instances.*

#### 2. Promote sponsors

Advertising and marketing the event is costly. Being able to promote sponsors through push notifications in-app is a valuable way to generate revenue before the event even starts. Sell ad-space on banners, customise information pages and promote individual speakers through a medium you *know *your guests will access.

#### 3. Overheads

Overheads stand for ‘any indirect costs that are still related to the event’. This includes ‘auxiliary support tech’ like what QuickMobile mentioned, which could be anything from WhatsApp to a Customer-Relationship Management system (CRM) to answer enquiries and other customer needs.

While it is true that you could coordinate your event through a judicious use of email, Excel, WhatsApp chat groups, landing pages and social media, it is **very easy to lose track of so many platforms.**

With an event app, you can have a bird’s eye view of all your running programs – especially useful with multiple events. Not only do you get rid of the possibility of (horror of horrors) *losing track of what you’ve sent out, *you also save yourself the time needed to create and update *every single platform*.

Even better: most event apps have also grown to include emailing capabilities, allowing you to upload guest lists and send out RSVP requests, confirmations and even full marketing campaigns without needing an email platform.

#### 4. Hardware

Many events often have a Q&A portion. Typically, attendees will go up to a mic stand to ask speakers their question. However, with an event app, not only can you do away with the mic stand (and wait time for the guest to make their way down), you can also moderate the questions asked.

On top of that, it’s been proven that anonymity will increase the number of questions asked.

Here’s some other hardware you can save on:

Schedule displays

Printers (not just papers!)

Cameras and cameramen (Leave it to the guests)

#### 5. Venue & Catering

Knowing how many people are actually attending can save you quite a bit in terms of venue and catering. One creative way of using the event app is by conducting a live poll at the start of the event to confirm numbers and determine any special dietary requirements.

Confirming the check-in numbers as the guests arrive is also a good way to know whether you need to open that side room to the main auditorium. (And whether or not you have a high check-in to RSVP rate)
