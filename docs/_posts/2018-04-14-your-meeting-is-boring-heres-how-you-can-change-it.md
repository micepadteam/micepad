There is an undeniable consensus that attending a business meeting is not exactly what we would call the most exciting event of the year. We have all been guilty of it at one point, when we strain our ears to pay attention and, oops-a-daisy, find ourselves falling asleep during a meeting. Try as you may, but you just cannot seem to resist the soporific voice luring you to sleep. Nevertheless, eschewing meetings is not the solution to the problem.

### Mobile-First Silent Traveller Phenomenon

### Towards An Interesting Meeting

So what happens now? You can either twiddle your thumbs and wait for guests to grow tired of congregating for a meeting or you can up the ante and make your meeting more interesting.

**Here are some ways you can go about doing so: **

### 1. Invite Good Speakers

Never underestimate the impact a good speaker can make on the audience. They know when the crowd is losing interest and are able to find ways to get their attention back. Some well-known speakers require an honorarium, but it will be worth it because of the sheer number of people the speaker is influencing.

### Present with Well-Made Slides

Beautifully-crafted slides are easy on the eyes and its compelling nature invites people to pay attention. In this matter, a clean design and smart font choice will go a long way toward making your presentation slides readable. Nobody likes a boring old fart, much less dull and dreary presentation slides, so feel free to mix it up with bits of text interspersed with images. Just as you can brighten up someone’s day with a rainbow bouquet of flowers, colourful images have the same effect.

### Create Unique Session Formats

Most delegates come to a meeting or a conference expecting the usual one-way dialogue with a predictable agenda. One way to keep things interesting is to switch it up with different kinds of session formats.  From our experience, some formats that have been used to great effect are: Panel Discussions, TED Talks and Distinguished Key Note Addresses. Not to mention the positive effects we’ve witnessed engagement tools have on facilitating two-way communication, even for top level meetings.

### Use Engagement Tools

Event apps are a powerful engagement tool that have been found to increase active participation****from the audience. With their attention fully on the speaker and the app, it increases their retention of material covered during the meeting, thereby making the meeting more productive.

What the Mobile-First Silent Traveller phenomenon served to illustrate is that the majority of the population is already very tech-savvy; so tech-savvy, in fact, that they find it difficult to part with their electronic devices. Considering how recent this phenomenon is, it goes to show how technology is able to catch on like wildfire. Thus, it is quite easy to introduce new EventTech into a meeting and get a high adoption rate.

You can capitalize on the mobile-first population by having them check out the elaborate contents of your meeting via an event app instead of checking their phones during the meeting. With this new-age technology, you can lure them out of their stupor and into the throes of your engaging content.  Since they are already accustomed to using technology, it will save you the problem of them having issues with the devices. Furthermore, the information-rich device plays to their tech-fueled curiosity, making your branding efforts more memorable as they fiddle with the device.

In this rat race, only the modern and wayward will prevail. Keep your meeting from being boring by enthralling your participants with a burst of excitement and a hip event app.

It might just be the very ingredient you need to freshen up your guests and make your meeting the meeting of the year.
