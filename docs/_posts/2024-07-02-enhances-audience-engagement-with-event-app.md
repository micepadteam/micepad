### How Event App Can Enhance Audience Engagement

There are ways you can maximize [event management software](../index.html) to help you kickstart your next event.

#### 1. Eliminating the Hassles of Print Media

Many events are still guilty of using printed programs for their proceedings. While we are not against print media, it might not be the most effective one for you.

With print media, organizers have to worry about things like how…

- Many copies of the program outline to print
- To effectively manage the resources spent on print media
- To deal with an unplanned change in the program, and so much more.

With an event app on your side, you don’t have to worry about that.

Afterall,[60% of smartphone users are already using their devices at social gatherings and events](https://www.eventmanagerblog.com/event-app-bible?utm_source=EMblog&utm_medium=Post%20announcement&utm_campaign=Post%20Announcement), so it wouldn’t hurt to tip your event app into their devices for the duration of your event.

#### 2. Better Program Access

Following from the above, event attendees can get a lot more done from the event app. Besides getting real-time updates on changes to the show at one point or the other, they also get to access multimedia resources (think slides, presentations, clips, videos, materials, etc.) from the event.

Likewise, it becomes much easier for a user to navigate exhibitors, keynote speakers, booths and sections of the event hall, if need be.

#### 3. Audience Engagement Boost

Your attendee never has to feel left out ever again when they have an event app at hand. With it, they can sync presentation times across their devices to get notified when a choice program is about to get underway.

Furthermore, the event planning software makes it easy to reach out to speakers/ exhibitors with questions and feedback after they must have left the podium. If this is not a great interaction and audience engagement boost to make your event even more successful, we don’t know what is.

#### 4. Improve Revenue for Sponsors

The [event sponsorship](virtual-events-sponsorship.html) who have dedicated their resources towards the success of your program also hope to gain exposure to all the attendees of the day. You can help them achieve this if you had a dedicated [custom event app](../products/mobile-event-app.html) for that event.

Here’s how:

- The app can be downloaded and installed before the event starts at all, giving your sponsors an early foot in the door.
- During the event, your sponsors get to reach out to the attendees with personalized messages and earn better audience engagements (and maybe conversions, as the case may be) from that.
- Following the fact that a huge majority use their smartphones in events, your sponsors can *always* be *actively present*.

#### 5. Seamless Interaction

Clear and timely communication is key at any event, and your [mobile event app](../products/mobile-event-app.html) makes it effortless. In today’s world where everyone’s glued to their phones, your app ensures messages are direct and timely, keeping attendees in the loop from start to finish. Push notifications and email alerts keep them informed before and during the event, while event guidelines and updates are just a scroll away.

#### 6. Easier Networking and Collaboration

Post-pandemic, in-person events are making a strong comeback, emphasizing the importance of networking and forging new connections. Does your event app act just as a tool when it should be able to bridge meaningful interactions? In the Micepad app, we facilitate networking among attendees and boost their return on investment by providing exhibitors and sponsors with personalized platforms to showcase products and engage directly with potential clients.

#### 7. Event Apps Gamification

Events today are all about creating memorable experiences, and event gamification adds a whole new level of excitement to the table. By incorporating elements of challenge, strategy, and competition, your app transforms ordinary events into thrilling adventures that everyone keeps their eyes on. Interactive challenges keeps your attendees engaged and energized, turning your event into an immersive experience they’ll remember long after it’s over.

### Wrap Up

By simply helping you save resources which could be better directed to making other parts of your event a success, boosting potential revenue and outreach for your sponsors while also ensuring a better experience for the attendees, incorporating an event app into your next event, conference, exhibition, seminar, etc. is a no-brainer.
