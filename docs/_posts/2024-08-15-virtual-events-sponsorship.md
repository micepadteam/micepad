In this post, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about enhancing sponsorship value in virtual events. While this may be a huge shift from how you originally intended to execute it, sponsorships in virtual event can still reap in great success stories. At the end of this post, you will attain an understanding on how to acquire sponsorship value.

### What Is Virtual Event Sponsorship?

[Virtual event](../products/virtual-event-platform.html) sponsorship is a dynamic marketing strategy where a company partners with an online event like a webinar or a virtual conference. By investing in your event, these sponsors are essentially buying into an opportunity to enhance their brand exposure, engage potential customers, and gain access to valuable data about attendees.

Unlike traditional in-person events, virtual events offer a different kind of exposure. While there’s no fixed start or end time guaranteeing a captive audience, this flexibility can actually be a boon. For example, sponsored content might have a longer shelf life as it can be accessed on-demand or circulated post-event, reaching a broader audience over time.

The appeal of virtual events has surged recently, bringing with them a large number of benefits. For one, they’re less costly and have lower barriers to entry compared to their physical counterparts. They also offer unique opportunities for creating highly personalized and curated content that can resonate more deeply with an audience. This means that as an event organizer, you can craft an experience that’s not just another generic online meeting but a meaningful interaction that sponsors will see as valuable.

So, when you’re pitching to potential sponsors, make sure they understand that supporting your virtual event isn’t just about putting their logo somewhere. They will create a partnership that offers substantial returns through enhanced visibility and direct engagement with a target audience. This not only helps them reach their marketing goals but also accelerates your ability to meet organizational objectives. It’s a win-win, crafted to make every participant and sponsor feel like they’re part of something special and valuable.

This will also attract potential sponsors to commit at an earlier stage, which will help you in charting forecasts with the estimate revenue.

#### 2. Downloadable Documents

Provide a deeper dive into what the sponsor offers through downloadable content like detailed company profiles or product info sheets. This is perfect for sponsors who want to share more about their services or products in a format attendees can save and review later.

#### 3. Marketing

Boost your sponsor’s visibility exponentially. Embed their logo on your event’s registration page and include it in all marketing emails. This continuous exposure helps keep the sponsor’s brand top of mind for all event participants.

Get loud with social media shoutouts. This not only increases the sponsor’s visibility but also enhances their reach by connecting them with your event’s social media audience. Make sure these shoutouts are creative and frequent to keep the engagement high.

#### 5. Sponsor Ribbons

These digital ribbons can be displayed alongside the sponsor’s name on the listing page, giving them an extra layer of distinction. This subtle but effective visual cue helps set sponsors apart from the crowd.

#### 6. Live Display Banner Ad

Keep the sponsor’s brand in constant view with banner ads that run throughout the event sessions. These are perfect for keeping the sponsor’s message front and center, ensuring continuous exposure.

#### 7. Screening of Logo

Regularly flash the sponsor’s logo during sessions. This can be a static display or a dynamic appearance during session breaks. It’s a simple yet powerful way to maintain brand presence throughout the event.

Offer sponsors a virtual booth, where they can interact in real-time or through pre-recorded content with attendees. This can be a game-changer for sponsors looking to simulate a real booth experience with live interactions.

### 12 Virtual Event Sponsorship Ideas

When planning virtual events, incorporating sponsorships in unique and interactive ways not only boosts the visibility of your sponsors but also ramps up the excitement for your attendees. Let’s walk through some top-tier virtual event sponsorship ideas.

#### 1. Branded Announcements

Imagine having the ability to send out real-time notifications that pop up during the event, or even as email and device notifications. For example, picture a pop-up sponsored by “IBM” that suddenly announces an impromptu live session on the latest tech innovations. This approach directly introduces the sponsor’s brand to the attendees, making them have stronger brand presence.

#### 2. Session Sponsorship

You can allow sponsors to ‘own’ a session by displaying their logos prominently alongside the session details and giving them a few minutes at the beginning to engage with the audience directly. For example, Mondelēz International kicks off a discussion on healthy food consumption with a short, compelling intro about their latest healthy snacks. It’s a great way to keep the session dynamic and closely tied to the sponsor’s brand.

#### 3. Portal Header Sponsor Carousel

Place a dynamic carousel of sponsor logos at a strategic spot within your event portal, where it’s always visible. Each logo could link directly to the sponsor’s website. Being featured in a loop that every attendee will see is definitely a way to give the sponsor’s brand constant exposure.

#### 4. Live Video Booths in Exhibit Halls

Transform traditional sponsor booths into interactive zones where sponsors can conduct live chats, presentations, or product demos. For instance, “Penguin Publishers” might host live sessions with authors, bringing a personal touch to the booth and making it a hot spot for attendee interaction.

#### 5. Pre-Roll Videos in Sessions

Before a session starts, why not play a sponsored video? This could be a tutorial from “Meta” about a new form of booming content right before a related tech seminar begins. It’s a prime way to keep attendees engaged right from the get-go and build anticipation for the session.

#### 6. Login Page and Lobby Banners

Customize the login page with a sponsor’s banner, which is the first thing attendees will see. Similarly, in the event lobby, use a large, eye-catching banner to promote a major sponsor. Picture “The North Face” welcoming attendees with a visually striking display featuring their latest outdoor equipment.

#### 7. Lobby Splash Video

Positioned right under the lobby banner, a looping splash video can serve multiple purposes, from welcoming attendees to highlighting sponsor messages. Imagine starting the event with a lively video that includes a quick welcome from “JPMorgan Chase” sharing useful financial tips—perfect for setting the tone of the event.

#### 8. Session Stream Watermarks and Lower Thirds

During your live or pre-recorded sessions, incorporate subtle watermarks or lower third graphics that feature your sponsor’s logo. This could be a discreet yet constant reminder of the sponsor’s presence, like having “Zenith Watches” subtly appear during discussions about time management.

#### 9. Exhibit/Sponsor Hall Booth Listing

Create a vibrant, interactive exhibit hall where sponsors can customize their space. Let’s say “Equity Residential” showcases their sustainable building solutions through virtual tours and interactive content. This turns a simple booth into an engaging experience that attendees can explore at their leisure.

#### 10. Gamification Engagement Codes and Prizes

Inject some fun with gamification elements like codes hidden around your event for attendees to find. You could have “Tencent” sponsor this scavenger hunt, offering prizes and making the interaction both fun and rewarding.

#### 11. Group Networking Rooms

Set up sponsored networking rooms centered around topics that showcase the sponsors’ expertise. For instance, a room titled “Exploring AI with OpenAI” could draw attendees interested in artificial intelligence, positioning the sponsor as a thought leader in the field.

#### 12. Lobby Social Media Feed

Integrate a live social media feed into the lobby to feature real-time updates and sponsored posts. This can be a great way to keep the content fresh and engaging while also promoting your sponsors in a dynamic way.

Each of these ideas offers a unique twist on virtual event sponsorship, providing value to sponsors while enhancing the attendee experience. By tailoring these strategies to fit your event and your sponsors’ goals, you create a vibrant, engaging atmosphere that makes your virtual event a memorable one.
