So, you have also heard that some of the professionals in your industry have started using online event management software, and you are at a loss as to why that is even a thing. Afterall, your event management team is doing great without one.

While we do not doubt that, it is still worth discussing.

How about we all keep an open mind while we look at what these are – and what they contribute to the success of the event at all?

But first…

What is an online event management software?

For the fear of sounding like a broken record, we would have said that this is a piece of software which allows event planners to manage their events even better. The truth, however, is that this does not even begin to skim the surface of the matter.

In reality, an online event management software is an important tool which helps in all of the pre-event (registrations, payments processing, audience mapping, etc.), event (engagement, personalized service delivery, etc.) and post-event (follow-up, email outreach, etc.) stages of planning and organisation.

This shows how important it can be to the success of an event when used right. To put cream on the matter, they also make for better event planning with every event which has been run through them.

Now that we have that out of the way…

What makes online event management software special?

Quite a lot, if you ask us. So that we don’t launch into sentimental speeches of how much this piece of software has done for us, we will let the points do all the talking.

### 1) Professionalism

Every event management company has to put their best foot forward to convince the attendees to even come around. That is why we cringe when we see fliers, event advertisements, registration forms and such other important documents with third-party watermarks on them.

Besides taking the professionalism away from the event management company – and the brand they are representing – it also makes the event look cheap.

That will not happen with an online event management tool, allowing you to create customized templates that your clients and customers are used to. Way to stamp your identity on the market, if you ask us.

### 2) Marketing

No matter how great your event is, you still have to market it.

Looking at many events across many years, it is obvious that marketing budget is one of the biggest costs of running the event itself. That, and we have not even mentioned the time that goes into such marketing.

What if we told you that you could cut back on the time and money, though?

Using these apps, you can sync with various social media channels and have a buzz created around your event. The best part is that all of these can be run on autopilot, giving you the time and resources to focus on more pressing parts of the event planning process.

### 3) Handling Payments

How would you like to safely and securely collect payments, accept donations, keep track of all checks and credit card information without breaking a sweat? Because that’s what you get when you use these online event management tools for your events.

Even if you were running a fundraiser – or accepting sponsorships for the event – this tool can help you dedicate a section to make that happen. The best part is that you don’t even have to be on ground to approve, accept or process any of the payments since the system has been trained to do all that on your behalf.

### 4) Improving Registration

Why wait by the phone to receive calls from potential attendees or scan through your email address to register interested applicants when you can have this automated too?

Day or night, online event management tools are equipped with the self-sufficiency to get the needed information from event attendees, work them into the system and assign them as needed. All you have to do is keep track of the attendees for personal purposes, and you are good to go.

You can even program the software to assign these attendees seats automatically, approve their feeding plan (if there is one) and handle their accommodation needs, if there be need for such.

### 5) Follow-Up

Do you know how many event planners find it difficult to keep in touch with attendees after the event is over?

For those who manage to do so, it would sometimes involve entering the contact details of each attendee into a new database. If they registered online, though, you are insured against going through all those forms of stress.

You now have all the information you need in one place, and even get to ask the attendees if they would like to receive additional content from you after the event has ended. Seamless communication and consent, all in one breath.
