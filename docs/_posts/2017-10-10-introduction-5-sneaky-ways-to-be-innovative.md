**Evolve, Or Die.**

They say change is the only constant despite the fact that, for the most part, humans are creatures of habit. It is important to always be on the alert for ways to improve. Today, new products are constantly being introduced to the market that even big businesses struggle to stay relevant. There is a need to ensure that you do not end up as a one-hit wonder.

### 1. Start From What You Already Have

Often, companies source for new ideas beyond their own pool of people. In fact, it is better to gather new ideas from within as they are more familiar with the industry and are constantly thinking about it. They may have already stumbled upon an idea to take the company further, but lacked the medium to articulate it. 3M is famous for their 15% rule, where researchers are given 15% of their time to work on something outside of their job scope, so long as they share their findings with their boss afterwards. This can be a great way to solicit new ideas without the additional expense.

Or, sometimes, it can be in the little things.

Albert Einstein did his best thinking near a shower. He was famously quoted as saying, “Why is it I always get my best ideas while shaving?”.

### 4. Take Walks Alone

### 5.  Dream for a Better Tomorrow

Steven Spielberg had a great habit of daydreaming and fascination. One of his greatest quotes said: “I don’t dream at night, I dream all day; I dream for a living.” This might have led to poor grades in school, but it paved the way to a great success at directing and producing movies and shows.
