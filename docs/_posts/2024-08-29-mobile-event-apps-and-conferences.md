The mobile app industry is booming, with over 6.3 billion smartphone users globally. People are practically glued to their phones. Did you know that the [average American checks their phone 262 times daily](https://www.reviews.org/mobile/cell-phone-addiction/)? That’s roughly every 5.5 minutes! We use our phones at work, at home, walking down the street, and even during meals. Chances are, you’re reading this on your mobile device right now.

Given how much we rely on our phones, integrating mobile apps into your [event planning](event-planning-challenges-and-solutions.html) is wise. These apps let attendees download the event details, log in, and participate seamlessly. They provide all the functionalities you could ask for and are optimised to look and perform great on any smartphone.

Your peers already see the benefits, from increased [attendee engagement](enhances-audience-engagement-with-event-app.html) to streamlined [event management](../index.html).

So, do you need a mobile event app? Absolutely. It’s a tool that meets your attendees where they already are—on their phones. It simplifies the event experience, enhances participation, and boosts your event’s success. Give it a try, and you might wonder how you managed without one.

### Find Out How Mobile Event Apps Benefit You

Now let’s dive into how mobile event apps can benefit you and your events. These apps are game-changers, and here’s why:

#### 1. Flexible Attendee-Oriented Experience

One of the biggest perks of mobile event apps is how they cater to your attendees’ preferences. Customising the event experience based on what interests them the most? Sounds exciting! Attendees can freely explore the agenda, choosing the sessions, topics, materials, and speakers that spark their interest. This level of personalisation keeps them engaged and satisfied. Features like interactive schedules, personalised agendas, and session reminders make this possible. Your attendees get a tailor-made experience, ensuring they get the most out of your event.

#### 2. Simplified Event Setup for Efficiency

As an [event planner](event-manager.html), your to-do list is endless. Mobile event apps can help streamline the operational side of things, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—creating an unforgettable event. These apps handle tasks like [registration](../products/online-event-registration-software.html), ticketing, and check-ins all in one place, saving you time and reducing the chance of errors.

#### 3. Enhanced Networking and 1:1 Meeting Opportunities

[Networking is vital to any event](event-networking-opportunities-ideas.html), and mobile apps take it to the next level. Many apps come with built-in features for chatting, polling, and surveys. Attendees can discuss the current talk, share their thoughts, and connect with others on the platform. These features facilitate 1:1 meetings, helping attendees build valuable connections.

#### 4. Improved Data Collection and Environmental Friendly Efforts

Think about all the paper traditionally used at events—brochures, flyers, agendas, and feedback forms. With [a mobile event app](../products/mobile-event-app.html), you can significantly reduce this waste. Everything attendees need is on their phones, making your event more environmentally friendly. Plus, collecting data becomes a breeze.

Event apps have dedicated survey, feedback, and attendance tracking features, providing accurate and comprehensive data. This is crucial because [19% of event marketers don’t have the right data](https://www.sweap.io/en/blog/event-planning-statistics), and 18% lack the tools to measure their event’s success. With an app, you’re hitting two birds with one stone—going green and gathering essential data efficiently.

#### 5. Increased Sponsorship Opportunities

[Micepad](../index.html), one of the mobile event apps, provides customisable digital booths for the sponsors and exhibitors.

[Event sponsorship](virtual-events-sponsorship.html) is a great way to boost your event’s ROI, and mobile event apps open up new avenues for this. This increases sponsors’ visibility and engagement, making it an attractive option. In fact, [60% of event marketers view event sponsorship](https://www.sweap.io/en/blog/event-planning-statistics) as a good strategy to increase brand awareness. By leveraging these opportunities, you enhance your event’s value and strengthen relationships with sponsors.

#### 6. Integrated Information

With a mobile event app, all the information attendees need is at their fingertips. You can leverage push notifications and [email marketing](event-email-marketing.html) to keep them informed and engaged before, during, and after the event.

Need to announce a last-minute change? Send a push notification. Want to remind them of an upcoming session? An email does the trick. This seamless flow of information ensures that attendees are always in the loop, enhancing their overall experience.

Alright, so you’re convinced that a mobile event app is the way to go. But with so many options, how do you choose the right one? The key is to find an app that meets the needs of your attendees and you. You can start by surveying them to discover which features they want to see in an event app. Use their feedback to weigh down your options, then ask yourself these crucial questions:

**1. Consider the size and scope of your event**

An event app might not be required to host a small workshop for 30 people or less. But if you’re planning a big event with thousands of attendees, you need one. Ensure the app is scalable, can handle many users, and performs well under heavy usage.

**2. Read reviews of different apps to get feedback from other event organisers**

This might be your first time using an event app, but you don’t have to start from scratch. Check out reviews on sites like G2, Capterra, and TrustRadius to see what other event organisers have experienced with various apps.

**3. Contact the app developer to ask questions about their features and pricing**

Once you’ve shortlisted a few options, contact the vendors. Ask them about the features, pricing, and anything else you need to know. If everything sounds good, request a demo to see how the app works in practice.
