Oftentimes, the networking part of an event is given the least importance. What most brands and event organizers don’t realize is not all participants are comfortable mingling with people they’ve only met for the first time.

Interactions simply don’t always happen naturally even during gatherings. Audience networking requires a solid structure and plan wherein the event’s objectives are met while convenience and a unique event experience are being implemented.

Transforming your event into a place where solid interpersonal connections can be built can be tricky, but this blog aims to provide a quick but thorough guide on how you can achieve that. Below are networking consideration you can employ for your next event:

#### 1. Event venues affect first impressions, and first impressions determine attendee mood

A great venue can spur a positive domino effect from the beginning up to the end of your event. Excellent ambience, lots of room to move around, and locations that are easy to find help entice participants all the more. When attendees find event venues easy to navigate through, this will save them the trouble of having to go over maps or get mixed directions to the location.

Outlining your event’s venue also means choosing the perfect venue that captures what your event is all about. Whether you opt for an outdoor meeting or an in-house gathering in a prestigious banquet hall, rearranging a venue to represent your brand speaks volumes to your attendees.

#### 2. Introduce your online community to your participants

Having a social media profile for your brand makes it easier to make your event known to your target audience. Let’s say your attendees really clicked during your event and both become avid followers of your brand.

Wouldn’t it be nice to be the link that keeps them in touch? Using your event to drive higher traffic to your social media page is genius. When paired with your brand’s event, your attendees are presented with an exclusive community where they can engage and continue communicating with fellow attendees even after the end of your event.

#### 3. Incentives are great motivational factors

Networking is also a give-and-take process. You can’t take or expect something from the other party without offering something of equal value in return. When trying to persuade an audience to participate in event activities and interact with fellow participants, sometimes the best way to do so is by recognizing attendee efforts and providing them with incentives in exchange for being cooperative. When you allow them to bask in the spotlight, give them the proper credit and recognition for sharing their ideas. The higher the level of involvement audiences invest in your event, the more likely they are to share their knowledge and experiences with each other.

#### 4. Maximize on shared interests of your attendees

You can have attendees fill out a survey prior to the event to help you sort and group all the answers. Then, on the day of the event, you can have seats arranged based on which attendees share common interests. Another example would be C2 Montreal’s Brain Dating Lounge.
