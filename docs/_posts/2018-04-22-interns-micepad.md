Ten weeks have passed in the blink of an eye and we are now bidding farewell to our interns from NTU and SMU. We hope that they have learned as much from us as we have from them 🙂

As a former Micepad intern, this brings back fond memories of the earlier years when we had just started up. Looking back, we really have made amazing progress over the [past two years](/about-us/).

As a company, Micepad strongly believes in nurturing future talents. Our interns are not photocopiers or coffee-makers (we use instant here!) but a real part of the team supporting events onsite, prepping event material and utilising our admin panel. They are fresh eyes and unique perspectives for not just our development team, but in sales and operations.

By involving them in work that is meaningful and has a direct contribution to what we do, we stand to gain so much more. We are proud to say that over the past ten weeks, we have seen many new ideas, new initiatives as well as improvements in our processes through their involvement.

If you feel that you have what it takes to be a Micepad Intern and are keen to join a fast-paced learning environment, join our internship program today! Write in to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f4919a85819d868db4999d9791849590da979b) to enquire.
