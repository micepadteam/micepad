![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is A-tech-expo-with-various-interactive-displays-and-booths.-The-image-highlights-the-mesh-networks-nodes-ensuring-smooth-connectivity-for-both-exhibitors-and-attendees.-Visual-cues-show-the-networ-5.jpg](/micepad-static/docs/uploads/2018/08/A-tech-expo-with-various-interactive-displays-and-booths.-The-image-highlights-the-mesh-networks-nodes-ensuring-smooth-connectivity-for-both-exhibitors-and-attendees.-Visual-cues-show-the-networ-5.jpg)

Zero UI basically refers to integrating technology into the entire space to initiate better and more seamless interaction. Technically, it isn’t a new concept. It has been incorporated in various technologies earlier, only this time the way it is interfaced into different devices is modified to suit more complex commands.

For example, technologies that use voice recognition and gestures to collect may not be as accurate and multi-dimensional as we think. A simple command such as ‘Call my sister’ may be fulfilled accurately by an AI assistant. But if the command is made more complex, the AI may not be able to fulfill it efficiently. Hence, the need for interfaces that adhere to the psychology of things is a must for the changing demands of consumers.

Anticipatory, automatic, and predictive technology will likely be received more warmly by end-users. In the world of event management, Zero UI shows that events can be used as a channel where a deeper level of communication among brands, target audiences and fellow attendees can be achieved. More importantly, inventive event ideas and concepts can be translated into more concrete executions.
