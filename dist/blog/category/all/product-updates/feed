										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With Singapore being home to numerous event venues, local event planners (like you) are probably familiar to the demanding nature of the job. Being stretched with “seemingly endless to-do lists” might be the norm—but that shouldn’t be when disseminating event information to attendees.</p>



<p>Yet, we say:</p>



<p>No to printed materials.<br>No to postal mail.<br>No to email updates.</p>



<p>And if your smart solution is mobile event apps, you&#8217;re in for a new headache if the tool is locked by long forms for a demo request. Why? Because many (88%) hate long forms and just leave them incomplete.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s where <a href="/" data-type="link" data-id="https://micepad.co/">Micepad</a> shines. The leading mobile event app specifically designed to empower event organizers of Singapore to self-sign-up so attendees enjoy smooth registration and ticketing.</p>



<p>How?</p>



<p>Learn more about mobile app software and <a href="/">Micepad</a> today.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are mobile event apps?</h2>



<p>Mobile event apps (also called conference mobile app) are applications made for event planners like you to ease organizing and improve the attendee experience before, during, and after an event. A good one ensures attendees can seamlessly navigate the event, remain updated on any logistical changes, participate in activities, and explore networking opportunities—all in real-time through their mobile devices.</p>



<p>So in a nutshell, a mobile event app means modernizing events and enhancing both the organizer and attendee experience through its mobile-first design and functionality. Its key features include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Agenda and schedule of sessions/activities</li>



<li>Interactive maps of the venue and exhibitor layouts</li>



<li>Speaker bios and presentation materials</li>



<li>In-app messaging/networking capabilities</li>



<li>Push notifications for important updates</li>



<li>Live polling and Q&amp;A</li>



<li>Analytics of the event’s performance</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why event organizers in Singapore need a mobile event app</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, Singapore has the facilities to host large-scale events like conferences, seminars, conventions, trade shows, and exhibitions. So, really, event planners here must adapt to technology fast to accommodate the country’s pace.</p>



<p>And to clearly point out the importance of a mobile event application for you, let’s go over some of your usual problems the app can solve:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">#1 You’re inefficient in disseminating real-time updates.</h4>



<p>Let’s be honest—sending mass emails is so 2001. One popular mobile event app feature is Push Notifications. It&#8217;s like having a megaphone to blast out real-time updates, except it&#8217;s much more convenient. The app is your control center for disseminating info smoothly and efficiently to everyone involved. So, last-minute changes? No problem—the app keeps attendees informed at all times.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">#2 You struggle with low attendee engagement and participation during events.</h4>



<p>Low attendee engagement and participation can really suck the energy out of an event. Conference mobile apps can pump up participation and get attendees invested. With interactive features like live polls, Q&amp;As, and gamification, attendees will be engaged and have way more ownership over the experience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">#3 There’s a lack of data and insights into attendee behavior and preferences.</h4>



<p>Take all the guesswork out of managing your events. A mobile event app feature provides valuable analytics on attendee behavior and preferences. Session ratings, attendance status, content downloads, and engagement levels—are some metrics that will paint a detailed picture of what people responded to and what didn&#8217;t move the needle (so you improve and better cater to attendees next time!).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">#4 For in-person events, attendees rely heavily on event staff.</h4>



<p>Basically, the app allows you to enable more self-service capabilities. It decentralizes and distributes key info so people can easily help themselves without handheld assistance. Here are some examples:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Instead of having info desks, attendees can access detailed schedules, venue maps, and speaker bios directly in the app.</li>



<li>Rather than waiting in line to register, they can get their ticket/badge scanned and use the mobile app for self-check-in.</li>



<li>If they need to exchange contact info or set up meetings, the conference apps for attendees have built-in networking/in-app messaging support.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How mobile event apps enhance the attendee experience </h2>



<p>Sure, a conference mobile app solves pain points for you. But it also shapes how attendees engage themselves in the event as a whole. Here are the ways it enhances the attendee experience:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Easy access to event information</h4>



<p>Yes, a mobile event application puts attendees in complete control of their event experience. This includes access to session details, speaker profiles, venue maps, and exhibitor listings. Attendees don&#8217;t have to carry around multiple printed materials, as the app is a centralized hub for all the information they need. And having all that crucial event intel at your attendees&#8217; fingertips creates a seamless experience.</p>



<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/C6cmxt0FxlPzqY-_WN-3Yttte0UwE4AxG0pip6oCQLfu3IYf74HDtlMCnG8npNbJqPJa6yA2SILna9OEPul0T41dTBKWHR5Drv9qrtKwxSPy7KUkU7-YXa9rfWABNMo68_NPqAxgv-nOolFQJNv-VRI" width="624" height="208"></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Personalized event experience</h4>



<p>In the old days, attendees only got that one generic agenda—even if half the sessions didn&#8217;t apply to them. But with conference apps for attendees, they can focus on the topics that actually matter to them. The app enables attendees to create schedules, book sessions, and socialize. And that networking opportunity helps build valuable professional connections and enhance the overall experience.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" width="624" height="181" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/DNYV4gLCUCrzbudAMPVtbegdbzlpHhXUe6OLBybYtgMZODLpePBsqF75QJXU6jyVC56VBLrQs6fofpbw9Hle7WgBbDM0vrKvpQYh6Q_gdSlsg_C6fPGNgq9B2g0eaI6b8eyOUC8QhW0je1CvuhfF7p0"></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Interactive features</h4>



<p>Imagine you&#8217;re at a regular conference without a conference app for attendees. You&#8217;re just absorbing content from the screen. Maybe you have some hot thoughts, but must hold them until a Q&amp;A period hours later—a recipe for poor attendee experience. But that’s before mobile event apps. Now, you can interact with your attendees in real-time. Talk about live polls and Q&amp;A features that empower them to voice their thoughts and get engaged right on the spot. Gamification elements like leaderboards make the event more engaging and fun.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" width="624" height="217" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VkGXxHV5A3xKAF0NELca-6gw-SsqV8gtRlK9UH4POpd9omiUiKXMlXK1ISfgnv_vE2VvFhvoPKb1JQ7hwOuDrgZyPMj10N439tMC3w4k2nZDwucIKUQ0WymsgfPdjoXS_BB5AzT8zfsXg-MJwP0ymxQ"></p>

									<p><strong>1. 1:1 Video Chat (August 2020): </strong>We will raise the bar for the networking experience by including 1:1 video. Connecting attendees, sponsors and virtual exhibitors directly is essential to building real experience that we want to create. In addition,  we will empower you to create dynamic micro-communities within your event space.</p><p>​<br /><strong>2. </strong><strong>Simultaneous Interpretation (August 2020): </strong>Event organisers that would like to include interpreters in their video conference events will now have the ability to enable language interpretation. This allows the host to designate attendees as interpreters on the virtual platform.  When the meeting or webinar starts, the host can start the interpretation feature, which will give the interpreters access to their own language channel. Attendees can select a language channel to hear their language of choice.</p><p>Supported languages include: Bahasa Melayu, Chinese, English, French, Korean and Japanese</p><p>Beyond the August release window we’re going to continue to work tirelessly on this new platform and keep you updated on the opportunities that we’re working on. Without revealing too much yet, one of our foremost priorities will be introducing new changes to the event management dashboard panel.</p><p><em>If you’re uncertain about what the virtual platform capabilities are and how much they cost, please do not hesitate to <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #63c339;">get in touch with us</span></a>. </em></p>								</div>

The change may look small, but we’ve found that it has a great impact on our users’ capability to assess the popularity of topics. With this update, we’ve taken more steps towards improving the measurability of our engagement metrics.</p><h3 class="tve-droppable" dir="ltr">Moderation Toggle</h3><p class="tve-droppable" dir="ltr">During many events, we’ve noticed that the moderation setting was especially popular with users. Indeed, this extremely useful setting has been one of the most used since the start of Micepad. However, we also realised that plenty of users would double and even triple check to make sure that it was on, which was why we decided to ease their concerns by moving the button securely to the front!</p><h3 class="tve-droppable" dir="ltr">New icon buttons</h3><p class="tve-droppable" dir="ltr">Micepad has always aimed for a sleek and clean panel design that maximises utility and user-friendliness. In keeping with this goal, we’ve switched the text buttons beside the messages to icons for not just a fresher look, but a more intuitive approach. </p><p class="tve-droppable" dir="ltr">Additionally, besides the append icon [+], we’ve also included the ‘screen’ icon to push individual messages to the projector screen.</p></div></div>								</div>
