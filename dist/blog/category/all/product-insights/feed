										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting </span><a href="/training/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trainings and workshops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great way to impart knowledge and help people develop a particular skill set. The beauty of this type of event is it holds a key role for people belonging in both the working and non-working class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, parents, employees, and even those who finished a vocational course can benefit from a training and workshop event. It is this universal nature that makes it crucial to design training and workshops that adhere to audience demands and learning objectives. Below are tips and tricks on how you, the training supervisor, can produce a highly useful training event for your target audience.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Organise Training and Workshops?</b></h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7093 size-full" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/male-speaker-giving-presentation-hall-university-workshop-audience-conference-hall_155003-27425.jpg" alt="male-speaker-giving-presentation-at training workshop" width="996" height="664" srcset="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/male-speaker-giving-presentation-hall-university-workshop-audience-conference-hall_155003-27425.jpg 996w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/male-speaker-giving-presentation-hall-university-workshop-audience-conference-hall_155003-27425-300x200.jpg 300w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/male-speaker-giving-presentation-hall-university-workshop-audience-conference-hall_155003-27425-768x512.jpg 768w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/male-speaker-giving-presentation-hall-university-workshop-audience-conference-hall_155003-27425-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important purpose of a training workshop is to equip participants with practical skills and knowledge they can immediately apply. (Credit: Freepik)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an <a href="/blog/event-management-software-for-event-planners">event planner,</a> you might be wondering why organising training workshops should be on your radar. Well, hosting these workshops can help you create meaningful experiences that drive real results to meet your <a href="/blog/event-roi">event ROI</a>. Here’s why you should consider making training workshops a key part of your event lineup:</span></p>
<h4><b>1. Empower Your Attendees with New Skills</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training workshops are fantastic for helping attendees gain new skills and knowledge. When you host a training workshop, you’re giving participants the chance to learn something valuable in a structured, hands-on environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your event not only delivers valuable insights from speakers to attendees but also enhances their abilities, ensuring they leave with practical skills they can apply right away. Whether it’s a new software tool, a management technique, or a creative skill, your workshop can be the gateway to their next big achievement. </span></p>
<h4><b>2. Boost Engagement and Interaction</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best things about training workshops is the level of engagement they foster. Unlike passive presentations, workshops are interactive and immersive. Attendees aren’t just sitting back and listening, they’re actively participating in activities, discussions, and problem-solving exercises instead. This hands-on approach makes learning more enjoyable and effective. It also helps build a sense of community among participants, as they work together and share their insights. </span></p>
<h4><b>3. Drive Tangible Results</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you host a training workshop, you’re not just organising an event; you’re creating opportunities for tangible outcomes. By focusing on specific skills or knowledge areas, you can ensure that participants leave with actionable takeaways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might mean improved performance, better problem-solving abilities, or enhanced creativity—whatever the goal, your workshop is designed to deliver real benefits. For you as an event planner, this means your event has a clear, impactful purpose that resonates with your audience.</span></p>
<h4><b>4. Use a Proven Framework for Success</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to design your training workshop is by using a divergent-convergent framework. Here’s how it works:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Divergent Thinking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by gathering a wide range of ideas and information. This is where you explore various options and perspectives. It’s all about brainstorming and finding out what’s out there.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Convergent Thinking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have all this information, it’s time to focus. Evaluate the options, prioritise what’s most relevant, and make decisions about the best approach. This phase helps you refine your ideas and come up with practical solutions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This framework helps ensure that your workshop covers a broad spectrum of ideas but also hones in on practical, actionable outcomes.</span></p>
<h4><b>5. Customise to Fit Your Audience</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7094 size-full" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/people-looking-football-game-sunny-day_23-2149015483.jpg" alt="A well-designed training workshop captures audience interest by delivering relevant content that directly addresses their needs and challenges" width="996" height="664" srcset="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/people-looking-football-game-sunny-day_23-2149015483.jpg 996w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/people-looking-football-game-sunny-day_23-2149015483-300x200.jpg 300w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/people-looking-football-game-sunny-day_23-2149015483-768x512.jpg 768w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/people-looking-football-game-sunny-day_23-2149015483-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A well-designed training workshop captures audience interest by delivering relevant content that directly addresses their needs and challenges. (Credit: Freepik)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of training workshops is their flexibility. You can tailor them to suit your audience’s specific needs and interests. Whether you’re hosting a workshop for event planners, marketing teams, or tech enthusiasts, you can customise the content and format to match their needs. This customisation makes your workshop more relevant and engaging, ensuring that it delivers exactly what your attendees are looking for.</span></p>
<h2><b>Successful Training and Workshop Essentials</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7098 size-full" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Training-and-Workshops.jpeg" alt="Tech-Training-and-Workshops" width="1050" height="700" srcset="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Training-and-Workshops.jpeg 1050w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Training-and-Workshops-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Training-and-Workshops-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Training-and-Workshops-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Training-and-Workshops-650x433.jpeg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<h3><b>1. Define The Purpose of Your Training</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are you holding a training session? What skills do you wish to develop in your attendees? What advantages do you want your audience to gain from your workshop?</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Be Specific About The Audience and Group Size You Want to Train</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning your training workshop, being specific about your audience and group size is crucial. Whether you&#8217;re catering to a small, intimate gathering or a large crowd, knowing who you&#8217;re training helps you tailor your resources and materials effectively. Some say keeping the group size small is best, but we believe you should have the freedom to decide based on your goals and what you want to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To really make your workshop impactful, take the time to understand your participants and their objectives. This means gathering information directly from them—through conversations, surveys, or even focus groups. By getting to know your audience better, you can shape the content, delivery methods, and discussion topics to resonate with them.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. List Down The Key Topics You Want to Focus On In Your Training</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These key topics will determine the pace of your training as well as the related concepts that your attendees will pick up during the event. How long will the training take? Pin down a final number of training topics, workshops, and activities that you want to prepare for your guests. By doing so, you will have a better idea as to the kind of resources that your event will be requiring.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Choose Your Materials Carefully</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you be inviting a guest trainer or will you opt to employ the knowledge and experience of an in-house staff with commendable training experience in the topic covered by your workshop? Choosing a mentor for your training and workshop session is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your audience to be engaged by a charismatic trainer yet at the same time be guaranteed that the person in-charge of teaching them is someone with commendable knowledge and experience. Here&#8217;s a handy checklist of materials to make sure everything runs smoothly:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>PowerPoint Slides and Presentation</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare your slides with clear visuals and add in your teacher notes along with the training activities. This will keep you organised and help make your presentation engaging.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Student Guide</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a comprehensive guide for your attendees. This can be a go-to resource for them during and after the workshop.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Printable Participant Certificates</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design certificates that you can hand out to attendees at the end of the workshop. It’s a great way to recognise their participation and add a personal touch.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Teacher’s Guide</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a detailed guide for yourself or other facilitators. It should include all the key points, instructions, and any additional notes to help lead the workshop effectively.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Feedback Form</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include a feedback form to collect insights from your attendees. Their input is invaluable for refining your workshops and making improvements.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Signing-In Sheet</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a sign-in sheet to keep track of who attends your workshop. It helps with organisation and ensures you have accurate records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These materials will help you run a smooth and effective training workshop.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Pick The Right Training Venue</b></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7097 size-full" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Workshop-Conference-Room.jpeg" alt="Tech-Workshop-Conference-Room" width="1052" height="700" srcset="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Workshop-Conference-Room.jpeg 1052w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Workshop-Conference-Room-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Workshop-Conference-Room-1024x681.jpeg 1024w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Workshop-Conference-Room-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tech-Workshop-Conference-Room-650x433.jpeg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1052px) 100vw, 1052px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not enough to just book a lavish hotel or a breezy outdoor venue for your training and workshop program. Take the time to study available venues and check whether these locations are conducive to learning or not. There are areas that are too cold or too hot. There are also venues that are too close to the city and may be prone to too much industrial noise and distraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick a location that has ample spacing, good lighting, is surrounded by a peaceful neighborhood and is complete with the amenities that you need. It can be tedious to find the perfect venue for your training event, but think of how it will benefit your guests for the entire duration of the program. There are a few key details you’ll want to keep in mind to ensure everything runs smoothly:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Confirm Your Training Room Booking</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double-check that your training room is scheduled and reserved.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Get Venue Support Contacts</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you have the contact information for essential venue support staff, like the key holder and IT support.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Provide Clear Entry Instructions</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that your participants receive detailed information on how to enter the venue and the training room. Clear directions will help them find their way easily and start the session smoothly.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Consider Accessibility</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discuss accessibility options with the venue. Make sure to accommodate all participants, including those who may need wheelchair access.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Plan for Refreshments</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk with the venue about the food and beverage options available. Depending on the duration of your workshop—whether it’s a short two-hour session, a half-day, or a full day—you might need to provide refreshments. At the very least, having glasses and drinking water available for your participants is always a thoughtful touch.</span></p>
<h3><b>6. Map The Learning Styles and Training Techniques</b></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7096 size-full" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Learning-Style.jpeg" alt="Learning-Style in training workshop

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each individual has different learning styles. (Credit: Freepik)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know your learners and assess what training or presentation techniques would be most suitable for the topics you wish to discuss in your workshop. For example, kinesthetic learners may benefit more from role-playing and hands-on activities than reading-writing learners do with handouts and articles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mixing up your lectures with demonstrations, group activities, and visual presentations will effectively make training sessions more dynamic and interesting for your audience.</span></p>
<h3><b>7. Evaluation and Learning Progress</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most important part of any training and workshop event. No matter how excellent your teaching materials are, it always boils down to the knowledge and skills your audience was able to develop at the end of your session.</span></p>
<h3><b>8. Assess Whether Your Training Approach was Effective</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget to disseminate questionnaires or include Q&amp;A’s at the end of each training session!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, what’s the point in learning new skills if your audience won’t be able to enjoy the entire learning experience? Making your training and workshop highly informative, inviting and overall a worthwhile experience for your audience will transform your event into something truly outstanding.</span></p>
<h2><b>Challenging Situations When Hosting A Training Workshop</b></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7099 size-full" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/training-workshop-challenge.png" alt="training workshop challenge" width="1122" height="738" srcset="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/training-workshop-challenge.png 1122w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/training-workshop-challenge-300x197.png 300w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/training-workshop-challenge-1024x674.png 1024w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/training-workshop-challenge-768x505.png 768w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/training-workshop-challenge-650x428.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenging situations when hosting a training workshop often include managing diverse participant expectations. (Credit: Freepik)</span></p>
<h4><b>1. Overcoming Low Attendance</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the trickiest parts of hosting a training workshop is ensuring a good turnout. While a smaller group can still be effective, it&#8217;s important that the right people are in the room. To boost attendance, make sure you&#8217;re putting in the effort to promote the event through the right channels. Highlight the specific benefits and unique content of your workshop to capture the interest of your target audience. Tailor your messaging to resonate with what your potential attendees are looking for, and make it clear why your workshop is worth their time.</span></p>
<p><b>Actionable Steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote your event across multiple platforms, including social media, email, and relevant online communities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly communicate the value of your workshop and how it aligns with your audience’s interests.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer early bird discounts or group rates to encourage sign-ups.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>2. Boosting Participant Engagement</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping attendees engaged is crucial to the success of your workshop. If the audience loses interest, your message won’t land as effectively. To maintain engagement, prioritise interactive activities and ensure the content is relevant to your participants&#8217; needs. Incorporate a mix of methods, such as hands-on demonstrations, group discussions, and Q&amp;A sessions, to keep the energy high and the audience involved.</span></p>
<p><b>Actionable Steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with an icebreaker to get everyone comfortable and engaged from the start.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a variety of activities to cater to different learning styles, like role-playing or case studies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage participation by asking open-ended questions and inviting input throughout the session.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>3. Managing Time Effectively</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time management can make or break your workshop. Balancing content delivery with interactive elements while staying on schedule is no easy feat. To manage time effectively, plan your workshop down to the minute, pacing each section so that you cover all key points without rushing or dragging.</span></p>
<p><b>Actionable Steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a detailed agenda with specific time slots for each activity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow buffer time between segments to accommodate discussions or unforeseen delays.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a timer or assign someone to keep track of time so you can focus on facilitation.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>4. Navigating Technical Issues</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any workshop, especially those held online, technical difficulties can pop up and derail your plans. To avoid these mishaps, thoroughly test all your equipment and platforms beforehand. Have backup solutions ready in case something goes wrong. This way, you can stay calm and keep the workshop running smoothly, no matter what happens.</span></p>
<p><b>Actionable Steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test all tech tools, including your presentation software, audio, video, and internet connection.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare backup devices or platforms in case of failures.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarise yourself with the virtual tools you plan to use, like breakout rooms or polls, to ensure a seamless experience.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>5. Preparing for the Unexpected</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how well you plan, unexpected challenges can still arise during your workshop. Being flexible and having contingency plans will help you handle these surprises without losing your cool. Whether it’s a last-minute cancellation or an unexpected venue issue, having backup facilitators and alternative plans will keep you on track.</span></p>
<p><b>Actionable Steps:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify potential risks and develop contingency plans for each scenario.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a co-facilitator or assistant who can step in if needed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate with your team and participants about any changes promptly to manage expectations.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>In shorts,</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a training workshop that truly resonates with participants requires more than just good content. In 2024, the focus is on designing experiences that are not only informative but also interactive and memorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As event planners, you have to remember: the goal is not just to share information but to create a space where ideas can be exchanged, and skills can be honed! Managing time efficiently is also key. Plan your workshop carefully, ensuring that each segment flows smoothly into the next without rushing or dragging. This way, you’ll maintain energy and focus throughout the session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, don’t forget to test your technology and have contingency plans in place.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though it might seem minor, the check-in stage can set the tone for your entire event. A rocky start can leave your attendees feeling less enthusiastic for the rest of the day. That’s why picking the right check-in app is crucial. With the best check-in apps, you can ensure a smooth, efficient entry that keeps everyone excited and engaged. Let’s dive into the top 15 free and paid event check-in apps that come with interactive features to make your event seamless and memorable.</p>
<h2>First of all, What Is An Event Check-In App? Do You Really Need One?</h2>
<p>Imagine the hassle of using pen and paper to check in hundreds of attendees—long lines, potential mistakes, and a lot of lost time. Nightmare, isn’t it? Event check-in apps are here to change that game entirely. These digital tools streamline the entire process, moving you from a cumbersome manual system to an efficient, tech-driven approach.</p>
<p>So, what exactly does an event check-in app do? It simplifies registrations by automating the check-in process, reducing human error, and cutting down on those frustrating long queues. With real-time insights, you can instantly see how many guests have arrived and gauge the popularity of different sessions that are currently happening.</p>
<p>Check-in apps also boost security with features like data encryption and compliance with payment standards, keeping your information safe from breaches. Plus, they allow for on-the-spot badge printing, so you don’t have to worry about errors or misprints with pre-printed badges.</p>
<p>But the benefits don’t stop there. Using an event check-in app also means reduced costs. Do you want to spend less money on staffing, printing, and hardware? With options to check in via QR codes or NFC tech, the process is fast and smooth, leaving your team free to focus on giving guests a warm welcome. Instead of just managing the checking in as the name represents, check-in apps also handle session management and lead collection.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to streamline your event check-in process and elevate your guest experience, then you’re in the right place! Let’s dive into our curated list of the 15 best check-in apps.</p>

<p>vFairs is an all-in-one event management platform that excels in supporting hybrid and onsite events with a highly functional mobile app. Since its inception in 2012, this modular <a href="/blog/what-is-event-technology-trends">event technology</a> platform has been instrumental in helping organisations manage various types of events, including conferences, trade shows, and hiring events.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>QR-Based Event Check-In</strong><br />
Assign unique QR codes to each attendee and send them via email. Upon arrival at the venue, attendees can quickly scan their QR codes using self-check-in kiosks. This personalised QR system simplifies and speeds up the check-in process with the mobile event app.</li>
<li><strong>Synced Check-in Tech and Registration for Payment</strong><br />

</ul>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>UX for booth reps and attendees. It&#8217;s so simple! I&#8217;ve also appreciated the hands-on support and responsiveness of our Project Manager. &#8211; CFP Board Spring 2024 Virtual Career Fair</li>
<li>They are constantly improving their products and services. The ease of creating our virtual job fair is second to none. &#8211; G2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>I disliked needing to set up mobile and desktop controls separately, for the virtual environment, but I understood why it was set up that way. I hope in the future the system can automatically adapt or allow you to check boxes from one control area for if something is accessible from both desktop and the mobile app. I also hope the registration platform gets enhanced and becomes part of the dashboard in the future and can support more dynamic form functions. &#8211; Anonymous at G2</li>

<li><strong>Individual Forms for Different Roles</strong><br />
Create and share personalised forms for attendees, exhibitors, speakers, and sponsors, ensuring a streamlined and organised registration process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Having everything combined in one place and app and being able to interlink everything (agenda, speakers, locations, etc.). Also the affordability of a whitelabel solution that is listed as a standalone app in the app-stores. Great and fast support whenever we had a request. Easy to implement and customise with an intuitive online interface, also able to manage multiple admin users editing at the same time.” &#8211; Philipp K. at G2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>The app got slow on the participant overview when a certain number of users was reached. This unfortunately led to long waiting times when trying to find a specific person on the app. Also we encountered some edge-cases in the backend where we would have wished for some more polishing. However nothing was too problematic, it was still by far the best solution we had for our yearly summit (since 2016) yet. &#8211; Philipp K. at G2</li>

</ul>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>The system is pretty much easy to figure out for the early 30s and younger group as we&#8217;ve grown up with computers and have typically become proficient with figuring out how to navigate programs. There are a lot of options and templates that allow you to quickly put together a website that houses basic information. &#8211; Julie Michelle D at G2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>In presentations to sell the Cvent service, there are several graphics and options shown that require the use of a graphics designer or one of their specialists at $150/hour. I&#8217;d have respected the company more if they only showed what their site could do alone.</li>

</ul>

However, users have noted that check-in can become challenging when using multiple devices.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time counting of all the check-ins:</strong> Keep an accurate and up-to-date count of attendees as they check in, ensuring smooth event management.</li>
<li><strong>Highly synced with multiple devices for the organisers:</strong> Seamlessly coordinate between various devices used by organisers to ensure a consistent and efficient check-in process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ease of Use: Splash makes it easy for me to create landing pages and registration forms without any coding knowledge. If I had to estimate, it&#8217;s dropped the amount of time it takes for me to create a page by 75%. RSVP Management: With Splash, managing RSVPs is simple. It collects RSVPs, lets you set event caps, and reduces manual tracking. Mobile Check-in App: The mobile check-in app makes on-site events much smoother, and helps paper guest lists and enhances efficiency during the event check-in process. &#8211; Kate R at G2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>The support is good, but I do wish we had more immediate response to questions or troubleshooting. I get that this is tough to scale and I believe more premium packages offer quicker support, but sometimes we&#8217;re in a bind and just need some simple guidance. &#8211; G2</li>

<li><strong>Real-time Analytics for easy navigation:</strong> Real-time analytics provide organisers with up-to-date information, making it easier to navigate and manage the event.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eventbrite is always up-to-date with the latest events happening in my area or in an area that I&#8217;m traveling to for work.

</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>The only negative is that we still had to manage who had and hadn&#8217;t been cleared by Crowdpass since it didn&#8217;t integrate with our registration system.</li>

<h2>11. Hopin</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6999 size-full" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hopin-2.png" alt="hopin" width="957" height="660" srcset="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hopin-2.png 957w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hopin-2-300x207.png 300w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hopin-2-768x530.png 768w, https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hopin-2-650x448.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px" /></p>
<p>Hopin&#8217;s event app delivers a smooth check-in process for both online and onsite events. It comes packed with features that boost accessibility, engagement, networking, and reporting for event organisers. However, one limitation is that it doesn&#8217;t support check-ins for hybrid events.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check-in Attendees:</strong> Easily check in attendees using Hopin&#8217;s streamlined process, ensuring everyone gets registered quickly and efficiently.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are a few cons. One of the most notable problems is the missing ticketing tool, which could be beneficial to us if we can sell conference access to attendees. Unfortunately, it is also not available, and we will have to wait for its release next year. &#8211; Jovan M at G2</li>
<li>The email templates are very basic and as someone with no HTML background, it&#8217;s incredibly difficult to redesign them. James D. at G2</li>

<h2>12. Eventdex</h2>

<p>Eventdex provides a comprehensive suite of tools that make ticketing and registration a breeze, effortlessly manage refunds, and easily handle walk-ins. One standout feature is the ability to clone previously built systems in minutes for both recurring and new events, ensuring that on-event check-in lists are updated automatically without any hassle.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Check-in Search:</strong> Easily search for attendees by their names, making the check-in process swift and efficient.</li>

<ul>
<li>The support team is just the best. They literally hand held me from the beginning until the end of my event. Very helpful and cooperative. &#8211; Anonymous at G2</li>
<li>I like the business model of the software. I also like the login dashboard display and the ability to see details at a glance. I have had good support when I have needed help. The navigation through the system is good. &#8211; Neil B at Capterra</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>I wish if the help section on the website had more self-help articles for first-time users. &#8211; Anonymous at G2</li>
<li>Eventdex&#8217;s strength is also its weakness. There are a lot of features and a new user can be confused by those. More simplification (like expensive software such as EventBrite have) will be great. &#8211; Rajesh M. at Capterra</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>Eventdex offers flexible pricing with no long-term contracts, no setup fees, no cancellation fees, and no hidden costs. To find the best package for your needs, you need to talk to their customer support.</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>The interactive experience, the ability to communicate. &#8211; Anonymous at G2</li>
<li>The Event Farm platform has brought our company to an entirely new level as it relates to our ability to create, promote, drive attendance and most importantly, successfully execute high-quality demand-generation client-facing events. &#8211; Andrew B. at G2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>The click through rate of the check-in process was low and concerned our leadership that our guests were not receiving event invites. We also would have liked to see better post-use stats to see where the improvements needed to be made. We also felt like there needed to be better design functionality. The pricing for the software is more than other event invitation softwares and over our budget. &#8211; Josie M. at G2</li>

<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>I like how daily check-in of your registered or walk-in attendees is one of the easiest ways to find out using the EventX check-in application. The check-in EventX application prepares pocket wifi, an Ipad, and a printer through which attendees from the event list are selected and with their name badge, a printout will come along. &#8211; Janavi R at G2</li>
<li>The EventX product was easily accessible to me. I, as a host of the event, was able to get control of my event. &#8211; Kerstin H at G2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>A few steps required to add event calendar to outlook for corporate email users. Magic link was difficult to understand at first and registrants did not complete registration,hence, need to manually imported list at the end. &#8211; Pongsupa W at G2</li>
<li>The EventX product does not provide me with proper management of my events, what feature will play a key role during my whole event, and how and when I will guide my attendees about it! &#8211; Kawi C at G2</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Registration Page</h3>



<p>First impressions are one of the most important ingredients for a successful meeting! But how do you plan for the perfect first impression to your guest if you&#8217;re not sure what they are interested in?</p>



<p>This is where the registration page comes in! Whether you&#8217;re sending an email invite to your guest or publicising an online event page, it is important to get basic information during registration. And that doesn&#8217;t mean just names, emails or dietary requirements.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t miss out on the opportunity to ask them things like which session attracted them to sign up for the event, what are their interests or even just one unique thing about them. Engagement doesn&#8217;t start on the event day, but way before!  A registration page is important to both the attendee and the event planner:</p>



<p>Not only do organisers get important information to provide a more personalised experience to their guests, they get to reach out and make a better impression by expressing interest in the other party. Additionally, it becomes possible to track each user’s interaction through the <a href="/products/online-event-registration-software">event registration app</a>, measure engagement levees and offer tweaks to the event to better the personal experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Agenda/Itinerary Outline</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Event-AgendaAgenda-Mockup.jpeg" alt="Event-AgendaAgenda-Mockup" title="Event-AgendaAgenda-Mockup"/></figure>



<p>One of the things attendees love to do when they get their printed programs is scan through all you have planned for them. No matter how power-packed this program is, know that not everyone will be interested in everything. Thus, make it possible for users to also pick what event they are most interested in, which keynote speakers they will like to hear, and set up alerts for those. </p>



<p>With <a href="/">Micepad</a>, not only can you add several days&#8217; worth of itinerary and scheduling, you can also separate attendees into different breakout groups (only the breakout group that they will be attending will be visible on their agenda), and attach the speakers&#8217; slides to the particular session!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Speaker Information</h3>



<p>If you want to upload unique bios for your speakers and/or any additional information, we also have a Speaker module for you. Fill it with text, links and even images just like any web page! Attendees always want to know who is speaking during each session. They may also want to find out more about the speaker&#8217;s experience, both personal and professional. </p>



<p>If the speakers allow it, you can even share their contact information with the attendees. Otherwise, just add links to their social media pages (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and/or website!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Floor Plan</h3>



<p>This is very important for an event with exhibitions. It is also ideal for multi-day, multi-center events. An accurate floor plan will help the attendee navigate their way through the grounds with minimal to no help from the outside. It also gives the chance to see where their favorite exhibitions are happening – so they don’t miss out when it starts.</p>



<p>Taking the floor plan one step further, Micepad has implemented the Exhibitor&#8217;s module, which allows users to attach pop-up infoboxes to specific areas on the uploaded floor plan for more detailed information on the particular place of interest. A favourite at trade shows with dozens of booths!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Messaging</h3>



<p>One of the most irksome parts of running an event is making an announcement. It might sound simple, but ensuring that everybody is notified of important information is a surprisingly herculean task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is a keynote speaker running late? Do you have one of the exhibitions starting earlier than scheduled? Or maybe there is an important accommodation issue you need to convey to the attendees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, a number of obstacles stand in your way: Some may have taken an untimely trip to the loo. Others may have gotten the munchies and decided to seek out a snack. A few may have left the hall a little earlier before lunch break to &#8220;avoid the crowd&#8221;.</p>



<p>All of these can be best communicated by sending a quick push notification through the <a href="/products">event app</a>. Not only is this easy and timely, but the best part is that you don&#8217;t have to track down all your attendees or make repeated announcements!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/micepad-app-newsfeed-1.png" alt="micepad-app-newsfeed" title="micepad-app-newsfeed"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Sponsors</h3>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all in-app notifications are good for! Push out interesting bites and thank you messages to attendees about your sponsors, pin their logo banners at the top of the discussion forum, or even carousel their banners on the main page! Additionally, you can dedicate a tab on the app to sponsors for more detailed information. </p>



<p>Your event sponsors deserve all the recognition that they can get. Now, you have even more options to showcase them to your attendees.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Networking</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Micepad-Business-Matching.jpeg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>While this is not a must, adding a networking feature will go a long way in boosting the <a href="/blog/enhances-audience-engagement-with-event-app" data-type="post" data-id="6423">audience engagement</a> at your event. Instead of leaving attendees to network the traditional way, allow them to connect with people of like interests via forums, discussions, and chats right there from within the app. There are various ways to setup your business matching module:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>With fixed appointment times at intervals of 15 min, 30 min, or 1 hour, etc.</li>



<li>At fixed &#8216;meeting spot&#8217; venues.</li>



<li>Through chat.</li>
</ol>



<p>Ask each guest what they are looking for at your event, and match them to their counterparts. For example, Angel Investors or Venture Corporations to Start-ups.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Survey</h3>



<p>One of the most important parts of event planning is right after it has concluded: when it&#8217;s time to request for feedback!</p>



<p>Not only is it essential for event planners to get continuous feedback to improve on the next time, it is also one of the metrics for calculating and <a href="/blog/how-to-maximize-event-roi" data-type="post" data-id="6712">maximizing ROI</a> and justifying the event to the various stakeholders.</p>



<p>Experienced planners know the pain of distributing paper forms only to have them returned empty or thrown into the trash bin. Even emailed feedback forms see low response rates, particularly when they are received once the event day is over.</p>



<p>The best time to get feedback is right after a session, and the best way to get that timely form distributed is in digital format &#8211; in particular, through your event app! It is much easier to get users to rate your event through an in-app pop-up notification then to have the MC ask them to please go to this URL and fill in the e-feedback form.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://micepad.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Micepad-App-Feedback-Form.jpeg" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Simultaneous Interpretation</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfGIEwz_nkNUaHNI59tmIgOYxQ4dWdVYMlAMRSqDbFXRKXNkrmZlJmUdHq0v-FlZ6Yyf0D5JaEK1vtlBZOJTmsOroCI9OI00DCA5L2EeQxvmhC8G50mxbzidiwenuP6AM5ThEWH5Uti4Zif0jev96vvFQ?key=WK_HupBSpAYCQWBucKIziw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Say goodbye to language barriers with real-time translation. Simultaneous Interpretation lets attendees translate audio into their native language on the fly. Hosting a multilingual conference? No problem! Just click a button, and your audience can follow along in English, Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, Malay, and more. This feature opens your event to a global audience, making it super inclusive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Exhibitors and Sponsors</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcIfQwapiwpVsl4XwSwba18A9KzGnQpOAj9m2-aa5CPtp5064anPrGdvnBpzHAc3rE-WXBCB5zoD3Y3FUJf-LZ6iV9OcjYfVh1L2eb3XpWFQvbraQJzEEJPwn8gGRG7N-s5aK2SEwEr6d7ps5ekmtEn4zqP?key=WK_HupBSpAYCQWBucKIziw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Networking just got a whole lot smarter. With event apps, exhibitors and sponsors can show off their products and services on customizable branded pages. These pages can have personalized content and give attendees easy access to company reps.</p>



<p>From virtual conferences to job fairs, trade shows to education fairs, this feature helps your exhibitors and sponsors connect with potential customers effectively, and our friendly team is here to support you every step of the way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">10. Private Chats</h3>



<p>Engaging with attendees has never been easier. Exhibitor reps can start conversations with multiple attendees at once through private chats. You can opt for text chat or video calls, making it easy to secure leads and discuss networking opportunities in a personal way. This feature adds a great touch to interactions and boosts engagement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">11. Event Information and Agenda</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXemGdfjSdQGO5huhBnZKxhqLkI5M3NOh5M5ot0ct-UuGRJOiWAIlvPuYoTRXqORAwGhtKrFBzOLCobnLYFB2rbEw_QHfq-HoDM9Q5t9axSAQe9qV3YY0CBOxTNWif4U1ykBBm-JNcLWEQJ4SXlWCAO_0W8?key=WK_HupBSpAYCQWBucKIziw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Keep everyone in the loop with up-to-date event guides available right on their phones. Attendees can create their own personalized agendas, ensuring they catch all the sessions they’re interested in. Plus, you can use push notifications to send important updates and direct traffic to key parts of your event, making sure everything runs smoothly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">12. Top Questions Display</h3>



<p>Make your Q&amp;A sessions interactive by letting your audience vote on the questions they want answered. You can display the most popular questions on a projector screen, ensuring the most relevant topics get covered. You control which questions are shown, making the session more engaging and audience-driven.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">13. Email Invitation and Reminders</h3>



<p>Start your event communication with style using beautifully designed email templates that you can customize to match your brand. Event apps make it easy to schedule and manage email flows, so your messages reach the right people at the right times. This keeps your attendees informed and excited from registration all the way to the event day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">14. Live Streaming</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf2_DK7IrrJAcFVM7Anh_NCq_-HDaHo7G1s2kWGDiEjrnfvr_GBoa0P9rl8kCcLgkjsEUpGNiQMbrVMBTNeZaMBHVIaCg1XfqMSs7GLuQFEqLe4yq0S5K3Qgj8k8c7T6pu5oaDcI_r2pQT1WzsAayYV24Y_?key=WK_HupBSpAYCQWBucKIziw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Take your event global with built-in streaming services or popular platforms like Zoom, Facebook Live, YouTube, Vimeo, and private RTMP streaming. You can mix live and pre-recorded videos to create a seamless viewing experience. This feature ensures your content reaches a wide audience, no matter where they are.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">15. Event Analytics</h3>



<p>You can’t improve what you don’t measure. Event apps offer a clean, intuitive data dashboard that collects valuable info during and after your event. Use this data to evaluate your event’s performance and plan for future success.</p>



<p>Creating and analyzing reports based on virtual event activity and in-person registration data helps you make informed decisions for your next event. These features make event apps essential tools that simplify the complex task of event planning.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you organise events frequently, <a href="/" data-type="link" data-id="https://micepad.co/">event apps</a> should not be new to you. Event apps help organisers digitise all of their <a href="/blog/event-planning-challenges-and-solutions">event planning</a> processes from registration to uploading of agenda, content, delegates listing and so on. More importantly, it synchronises the work across all your fellow organisers to keep everyone in the loop.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>A digital event platform (DEP) transforms traditional gatherings into engaging online experiences, facilitating webinars, <a href="/blog/mobile-event-apps-and-conferences">virtual conferences</a>, business meetings and social events worldwide. Digital event platforms enhance productivity with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automated <a href="/blog/event-registration">registration</a> and <a href="/blog/event-check-in">check-in processes</a>.</li>
<li>Provide a centralized information library and streamline content management.</li>
<li>Increase attendee participation through interactive features and real-time engagement.</li>
<li>Reap a robust data collection for post-event evaluation and continuous improvement</li>
<li>Embrace digital to tailor experiences, extend event impact, and ensure flexibility for hybrid or large-scale events.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What Is A Digital Event Platform?</h2>
<p>A digital event, often facilitated by a digital event platform (DEP), transforms traditional in-person gatherings into interactive online experiences. These platforms are designed to recreate the lively atmosphere of physical events centered in one virtual space. They cover a range of online experiences such as webinars, virtual conferences, and social gatherings, where attendees can join from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Most digital event platforms offer tools for managing agendas, handling <a href="/products/online-event-registration-software">event registrations</a>, presenting video content, engaging with the audience, and analyzing participation. With the surge in popularity, especially during recent times, digital events break down geographical barriers, allowing people worldwide to connect in real time from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<h2>Why Your Next Event Should Go Digital</h2>
<p>Here are the top 5 reasons to digitise your event for increased productivity.</p>
<h3>1. Automated Registration Check-In</h3>
<p>The last thing you want to do for <a href="https://sgpad.com/event-registration/">event registration</a> is to go through your guest lists, filter your guests accordingly and send out a personalised email one by one. This is super time-consuming. I believe you would agree with me that automating this process can increase your productivity. On the event day, your guests can even scan their QR code to self-check-in. More importantly, they can complete the <a href="/blog/online-event-registration">registration process</a> and proceed to the hall within a few minutes.</p>
<h3>2. Information Library</h3>
<p>Your attendees need to know about your event information. Having a digital copy of everything provides so much convenience for everyone. The app stores all your content from session schedules to delegate listing, venue map and other important documents. Aside from having a digital copy, you get to save a lot of printing costs!</p>
<p>If you organise events frequently, <a href="/products/mobile-event-app">mobile event apps</a> should not be new to you. Event apps help organisers digitise all of their planning processes from registration to uploading of agenda, content, delegates listing and so on. More importantly, it synchronises the work across all your fellow organisers to keep everyone in the loop.</p>
<h3>3. Content Management</h3>
<p>For event organisers that require frequent updates, the ease of content management is important. At the minimum, the platform should be intuitive. The good thing about having an <a href="/blog/how-event-app-can-reduce-event-costs">event app</a> is the ability to upload your last-minute changes in real-time. You can make the amendments and your attendees can be notified immediately.</p>
<h3>4. Increase Your Participation Level</h3>
<p>Who doesn’t want a participative audience? Event app helps increase the participation level of your attendees. For attendees who fear public speaking, they can ask a question anonymously through the event app. Your speakers can also grasp the attendees’ sentiments immediately through the real-time audience responses.</p>
<h3>5. Data Collection</h3>
<p>At the end of your event, you need data to evaluate your performances. The ease of data collection is another key consideration for an event app. It allows you to retrieve your reports instantaneously after each session. That said, you can definitely call for a meeting with all the reports on hand immediately after the event has ended.</p>
<h3>6. Get to Know Your Participants Better</h3>
<p>When you use a digital event management software, you can gather valuable insights about your attendees even before your event kicks off. You&#8217;ll know which sessions they&#8217;re keen on, what grabs their interest, and even get feedback on what they&#8217;d like to see. This helps you tailor your event to make sure it hits all the right spots for your guests. For example, by tracking participant preferences and attendance patterns, you can fine-tune your event planning for maximum impact and satisfaction.</p>
<h3>7. Flexibility and Scalability</h3>
<p>Digital platforms offer incredible flexibility, especially handy for hybrid events or large gatherings. You can easily adjust your agenda in real-time and accommodate guests from anywhere in the world. This flexibility means you can handle last-minute changes smoothly, whether it&#8217;s a speaker switch-up or a venue tweak. Choosing a robust event management software provider ensures you have the support to navigate these changes effortlessly, making your event management a breeze.</p>
<h3>8. Extended Event Impact</h3>
<p>Digital event platforms don’t just end when the event does—they keep your content alive long after. Your sessions can stay accessible online, giving sponsors and exhibitors more time to connect with attendees. This prolonged engagement boosts your <a href="/blog/event-roi">event ROI</a> and keeps your messages resonating well beyond event day. For instance, offering on-demand sessions or creating content hubs keeps participants engaged and networking active even after the event wraps up.</p>
<h3>9. Personalized Participant Experience</h3>
<p>With digital tools, you can give attendees a truly customized experience. They can pick and choose sessions that match their interests and goals, making their time at your event more valuable. This personal touch enhances attendee satisfaction and ensures they get the most out of every moment. Best practices include using attendee profiles to suggest relevant sessions, interactive features for real-time feedback, and easy-to-navigate interfaces that put attendees in control.</p>
<h3>10. Real-Time Engagement and Feedback</h3>
<p>Digital agendas empower you to engage attendees instantly with live polls, Q&amp;A and surveys. This immediate interaction helps you gauge their reactions in real time and tweak things on the fly. For instance, incorporating live feedback during sessions ensures that you&#8217;re meeting participant expectations and adapting your event as it unfolds. This dynamic approach fosters a lively exchange between you and your attendees, making your event not just informative but also interactive and fun.</p>
<p>By harnessing digital event management software, whether for <a href="/products/virtual-event-platform">virtual events</a>, <a href="/solutions/hybrid-events">hybrid events</a>, or in-person events, make sure that you’re creating an experience that’s seamless, engaging, and memorable.</p>
<p>The critical decision you need to make before deciding on an event app is choosing the type of app that best fit your event objectives. Having a single app tailored from your pre-event to post-event provides a continual flow of your data collection.

This would not be an issue with online check-in apps which would allow such details to be updated over the air instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, modifications to existing data is made smoother and neater with check-in software. In practice, they make it easy for the attendee to request and update accommodation status, food preferences, preferred activities and much more. All of that is done in such a way that beats having to cross the details out from a piece of paper – or simply issuing another piece of document to that effect.</p><p dir="ltr">In the same vein, keeping close track of the data is made possible. While papers can get lost and missing, the information from online options will be stored in the cloud forever. That way, it can always be accessed anywhere and at any time, as long as the viewer has the required permissions to view such data.</p></div><div class="thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption" data-css="tve-u-1708a91eb50"> </div>								</div>

This is almost because, at the end of the event, there is no way to gather a convincing percentage of the attendees for their thoughts to be estimated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thankfully you can always track metrics of usage, interaction and other KPIs as the app is being used by the different attendees. Even without a dedicated form for getting user feedback – which can still be ingrained into the app – you can always have actionable data on the rest of your defined objectives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Likewise, event apps make interacting with the event much easier for attendees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Right from within the app, they can set schedules for events they want to attend, enable reminders for exhibitions to not miss, and more. Furthermore, the app can be used to aggregate all user questions to be shared with the keynote speakers/ presenters at the end of their session.</p>

<p dir="ltr">One of the most important metrics to an event planner is the ROI they get on their various events. It is, thus, little wonder why <a href="https://blog.bizzabo.com/event-apps-guide"><span style="color: #63C339;">91% of event planners</a> have gone for event apps – and have recorded positive returns on investment by so doing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is made possible by all of the easier follow-ups on the attendees much after the event is done, better optimization of product placements, and much more. Likewise, the in-app experience enables promoters to showcase their products – and that of the sponsors – in a single location while the event is ongoing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even if you have been recording positive ROI on your events to date too, you can get even higher plus figures when you incorporate event apps. Likewise, this is the best time to start so that you don’t fall back too much in the industry.</p>
