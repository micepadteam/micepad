### What Is Event Registration?

Event registration is the entire process where attendees sign up to join your event all the way till the point when they arrive onsite and collect their badges. Your event registration is the starting point that sets the stage for everything else. As an event planner, nailing this step is crucial because it’s not just about getting people in the door—it’s about ensuring the right people are there to make your event a big success.

Whether you’re organizing a conference, trade show, or any gathering, the goal is clear: you want the right mix of participants who can connect, share ideas, and contribute to the event’s success. A smooth registration process can be your first chance to make a positive impression and gather key info that helps you tailor the event experience.

By collecting attendee details upfront, you can personalize their journey, plan effectively, and foster the [event engagement](increase-event-engagement.html). This means attendees feel valued and prepared, setting the stage for productive networking and meaningful interactions. Essentially, event registration is the backbone of your event planning, influencing everything from logistics to overall impact of your event.

### Event Registration and Check-In Tips

#### 1) Optimize for Mobile

About [80% of all internet users own a smartphone](https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-day/80-of-internet-users-own-a-smartphone/). Of these, an even larger percentage prefer to check things on their phones than with their desktop computers. This is because we now consume content on-the-go, and the same thought should go into your registrations page.

Make sure the mobile page is optimized for a seamless experience. By that, we mean making the peg responsive such that it fits different screen sizes perfectly. Likewise, make sure the page loads fast – seeing as [7% of conversions are lost](https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/) with every one second delay in page load speed.

#### 2) Simplify the Process

Time is important, and no one wants to spend too much time than necessary trying to get into your event. Thus, your registration page should be as short, simple and straight to the point as needed.

Only request valuable information and leave out all the noise. Likewise, make sure you don’t put hidden fees at the end, presenting them upfront instead.

At the same time, you might want to do away with Captchas. Having been [proven to cause a drop in registration conversions](https://moz.com/blog/captchas-affect-on-conversion-rates), you don’t want to hurt your event that bad before it even starts at all.

#### 3) Multiple Payment Options

Thinking PayPal is everywhere, or making such other generalizations as to payment platforms, can hamper certain potential attendees from registering for the event at all. This is why you should always consider allowing multiple payment options so that people from anywhere can have a shot at registering too.

To do so would be to implement support for both credit and debit cards. Likewise, supporting cards from overseas is a great pick for if you’re expecting attendees from other parts of the world.

#### 4) Enable Group Registration

You might not know this, but you (the event planner/ manager) stand to gain more from group registrations than the attendees themselves.

When people register in groups, it becomes easier to plan seating arrangements for them. At the same time, you get to get the payment as a lump sum since the group head would be the one to handle the expenses.

Now that you know why they are great, you could push people into group registrations by offering a freebie with their package, discount on the total amount, and more.

#### 5) Gather Relevant Information

Remember the first point on keeping things simple? Well, you also have to know what the essentials are before going for simple.

For example, an event where food will be served will probably need a page on dietary restrictions, food allergies and such other information to plan ahead.

While keeping things simple, also plan ahead in line with the programmes and provisions for the day. If it contributes to the overall attendee experience, then it should be on the registrations page.

#### 6) Stay On-Site

Internet users are now more in tune with cybersecurity protocols, so you should not spook them with your event registration. The best way to do so is keeping things on your website using [event management system](../index.html) rather than having them redirected to a new URL.

Thus, have it such that your registration forms are built directly into your website, not hosted on some third-party platform.

Even if you were going for the latter solution, make sure it is a secure URL, carries your branding information and all that.

#### 7) Cater to the Traditional

Did you know that some of your attendees would still like to fill out their registrations on paper? That might sound old fashioned and traditional, but doesn’t make it any less true.

For these people, you could provide an option for them to indicate such interest on your website. On doing so, they should get a downloadable form which can then be sent to you via regular mail.

Depending on the target audience you are dealing with, you might never have anyone go for that option. When you do, though, you know that you have met that particular attendee at the very point of their unique needs.

### Marketing Strategies to Boost Event Registration

In essence, a successful event starts with packed and valuable attendees queueing for registration. Try some of these tips to boost yours:

#### 1. Promote Your Event

Getting people to your event starts with spreading the word. Whether it’s online, offline, or a mix of both, you need a solid plan to get noticed. Social media is your friend here—not just for posting, but for jumping on trends that can boost your reach. Think videos and eye-catching visuals that make people want to click ‘register’. Tailor your message to fit your crowd—whether they’re startup buffs or corporate pros.

#### 2. Leverage Your Speakers and Sponsors

Your event’s speakers and sponsors are your secret weapons. Ask them to shout about your event to their followers and give them ready-made posts and graphics to share. Show off their expertise with a series of posts that build excitement and trust.

#### 3. Spread Clear CTA Buttons All Over Your Landing Page

Make it easy for people to sign up by putting ‘register now’ buttons everywhere—from your homepage to the end of your blog posts. Keep it simple and direct so nobody gets lost on the way to signing up.

#### 4. Member Get Member Program

Turn your past attendees into your biggest cheerleaders. Offer them perks like discounts or exclusive content for bringing in new faces. This not only grows your guest list but also builds a community of excited attendees who can’t wait to join in.
