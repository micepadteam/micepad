# Micepad: Swipe Your Way to a Great Conference

*April 10, 2018*

---

As the name suggests, Micepad is derived from the merging of two concepts: MICE and iPads. MICE represents the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions Industry. Built and designed with the end user in mind, Micepad is integrated to run across any device, ranging from iOS, Android and even the web, to increase audience engagement and generate valuable insights** **during MICE events. Our work began in 2013 when we discovered an untapped area in the MICE Industry at a time when Singapore had already been established as one of the leading MICE destinations. Since then, Micepad has been deployed all across Asia by top-tier banking and pharmaceutical companies, reaching even as far as Australia and North America.

### Paperless Conferences

Micepad aims to pave the way towards a modern way of conducting MICE events with our software and event support. Our mobile solution caters not only to the tech-savvy generation but also to the older generation through our user-friendly interface. Gone are the days when last-minute printing and stacks of event materials are the norms. With Micepad, companies can reduce their carbon footprint, making a difference not only to the environment but also to the richness of information they gather through each event.

### Customised Design

At Micepad, we understand the importance of branding and distinct individuality. Hence, we go the extra mile to customise our App according to your needs and branding. There is no need to fear that your event would appear identical to another company; each design is unique and built for you.
